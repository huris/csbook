They make it easier to program Ajax and provide powerful features like drag and drop and animation. In this book, developers learn by playing and see how the libraries work in the real world.\nAs experience with Ajax increases, developers want the standard Ajax capabilities they repeatedly use to be preprogrammed for them and that s exactly what Ajax libraries do for them. They reduce the pain of handling cross-browser inconsistencies, they add useful language features, and provide sophisticated functionality. Of these, Prototype is the most popular JavaScript and Ajax framework for low-level user interface features such as animation, drag and drop, and pre-built widgets. Together, they free the developer up to concentrate on building the application. They make a rich user experience easy to achieve.\nThis book guides the reader through the Prototype and Scriptaculous libraries feature-by-feature. In just 350 pages, readers will find over 100 small working examples to help them explore the libraries. As well, they will develop a web-based image gallery that teacher them how to use Prototype and Scriptaculous in the real-world.\nPurchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning.

Microservices approach allows this type of changes with ease as only a part of the system undergoes changes and change control is easy.\nAn example of such large system can be an online store\u2015includes user interface, managing product catalog, processing orders, managing customer s account. In a microservices architecture each of these tasks will be divided and into smaller services.

It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python s clear, concise syntax.\nObject-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception.\nStarting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.\nYou ll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python s unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.\nYou will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you ll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you ll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You ll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy.\nThis new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It s also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.\nWhat You Will LearnImplement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods\nSeparate related objects into a taxonomy of classes and describe the properties and behaviors of those objects via the class interface\nExtend class functionality using inheritance\nUnderstand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them\nDiscover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python\nUncover the simplicity of unit testing and why it s so important in Python\nGrasp common concurrency techniques and pitfalls in Python 3\nExploit object-oriented programming in key Python technologies such as Kivy and Django.\nObject-oriented programming concurrently with asyncio", "name": "Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming, Second Edition", "category": "Python"},

These applications have all of the advantages of those written in Objective-C or Java, combined with the rapid development cycle that JavaScript developers are accustomed to.\nWeb developers who want to develop native mobile applications face a high barrier to entry, because they are forced to learn platform-specific languages and frameworks. Numerous hybrid technologies have tried to simplify this process, but have failed to achieve the performance and appearance that users expect.\nThis book will show you all the advantages of true native development that React Native has without the steep learning curve, leveraging the knowledge you already have. We do this by getting you up and running quickly with a sample application. Next, we ll introduce you to the fundamentals of creating components and explain how React Native works under the hood. Once you have established a solid foundation, you will dive headfirst into developing a real-world application from start to finish. Along the way, we will demonstrate how to create multiple screens and navigate between them,use layout and style native UI components, and access native APIs such as local storage and geolocation. Finally, we tackle the advanced topic of Native modules, which demonstrates that there are truly no limits to what you can do with React Native.", "name": "Getting Started with React Native", "category": "JavaScript"},

From geometry to basic Artificial Intelligence algorithms, there are plenty of concepts that can be applied in almost every game. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. It is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not predominantly based on C. Python is also very easy to code and is also highly flexible, which is exactly what is required for game development. The user-friendliness of this language allows beginners to code games without too much effort or training. Python also works with very little code and in most cases uses the \u201cuse cases\u201d approach, reserving lengthy explicit coding for outliers and exceptions, making game development an achievable feat.\nPython Game Programming by Example enables readers to develop cool and popular games in Python without having in-depth programming knowledge of Python. The book includes seven hands-on projects developed with several well-known Python packages, as well as a comprehensive explanation about the theory and design of each game.\nIt will teach readers about the techniques of game design and coding of some popular games like Pong and tower defense. Thereafter, it will allow readers to add levels of complexities to make the games more fun and realistic using 3D.\nAt the end of the book, you will have added several GUI libraries like Chimpunk2D, cocos2d, and Tkinter in your tool belt, as well as a handful of recipes and algorithms for developing games with Python.", "name": "Python Game Programming By Example", "category": "Python"},

JavaScript s implementation allows us to perform complex tasks with a few lines of code using regular expressions to match and extract data out of text.\nThis book starts by exploring what a pattern actually is and how regular expressions express these patterns to match and manipulate user data. You then move on to learning about the use of character classes to define a wild character match, a digit match, and an alphanumeric match. You will then learn to manipulate text and shorten data in URLs, paths, markup, and data exchange, as well as other advanced Regex features.\nFinally, you will work through real-world examples, both in the browser and on the server side using Node.js.", "name": "JavaScript Regular Expressions", "category": "JavaScript"},

The HTML5 video standard enables browsers to support audio and video elements natively. This makes it very easy for web developers to publish audio and video, integrating both within the general presentation of web pages. For example, media elements can be styled using CSS (style sheets), viewed on a mobile device, and manipulated in a Canvas or an audio filter graph. The book offers techniques for providing accessibility to media elements, enabling consistent handling of alternative representations of media resources. The update includes all of the changes and revisions since the first HTML5 draft.\nBeginning HTML5 Media dives deep into the markup that is introduced for media element support in browsers. You\u2019ll explore the default user interface offered through browsers for media elements, as well as the JavaScript API provided to control their behavior. You\u2019ll also learn how to account for H.264, WebM and Ogg Theora codecs as well as explore the emerging Web Audio API standard, which provides an extensive set of hardware-accelerated audio filters to achieve a level of audio signal manipulation in the browser previously only available to audio professionals.", "name": "Beginning HTML5 Media, 2nd Edition", "category": "HTML, HTML5 &amp; CSS"},

XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, is a specification for storing information. It is also a specification for describing the structure of that information. And while XML is a markup language (just like HTML), XML has no tags of its own. It allows the person writing the XML to create whatever tags they need. The only condition is that these newly created tags adhere to the rules of the XML specification.\nIn the seven years since the first edition of \u201cXML: Visual QuickStart Guide\u201d was published, XML has taken its place next to HTML as a foundational language on the Internet. XML has become a very popular method for storing data and the most popular method for transmitting data between all sorts of systems and applications. The reason being, where HTML was designed to display information, XML was designed to manage it.\nThis book begins by showing you the basics of the XML language. Then, by building on that knowledge, additional and supporting languages and systems will be discussed. To get the most out of this book, you should be somewhat familiar with HTML, although you don\u2019t need to be an expert coder by any stretch. No other previous knowledge is required.\n\u201cXML: Visual QuickStart Guide, 2nd Edition\u201d is divided into seven parts. Each part contains one or more chapters with step-by-step instructions that explain how to perform XML-related tasks. Wherever possible, examples of the concepts being discussed are displayed, and the parts of the examples on which to focus are highlighted.\nThe order of the book is intentionally designed to be an introduction to the fundamentals of XML, followed by discussions of related XML technologies.\n\u2022 In Part 1 of the book, you will learn how to create an XML document. It\u2019s relatively straightforward, and even more so if you know a little HTML.\n\u2022 Part 2 focuses on XSL, which is a set of languages designed to transform an XML document into something else: an HTML file, a PDF document, or another XML document. Remember, XML is designed to store and transport data, not display it.\n\u2022 Parts 3 and 4 of the book discuss DTD and XML Schema, languages designed to define the structure of an XML document. In conjunction with XML Namespaces (Part 5), you can guarantee that XML documents conform to a pre-defined structure, whether created by you or by someone else.\n\u2022 Part 6, Developments and Trends, details some of the up-and-coming XML-related languages, as well as a few new versions of existing languages.\n\u2022 Finally, Part 7 identifies some well-known uses of XML in the world today; some of which you may be surprised to learn.\nThis beginner\u2019s guide to XML is broken down as follows:<br />\n\u2022 Introduction<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 1: Writing XML\n\u2022 Part 2: XSL<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 2: XSLT<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 3: XPath Patterns and Expressions<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 4: XPath Functions<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 5: XSL-FO\n\u2022 Part 3: DTD<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 6: Creating a DTD<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 7: Entities and Notations in DTDs<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 8: Validation and Using DTDs\n\u2022 Part 4: XML Schema<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 9: XML Schema Basics<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 10: Defining Simple Types<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 11: Defining Complex Types\n\u2022 Part 5: Namespaces<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 12: XML Namespaces<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 13: Using XML Namespaces\n\u2022 Part 6: Recent W3C Recommendations<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 14: XSLT 2.0<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 15: XPath 2.0<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 16: XQuery 1.0\n\u2022 Part 7: XML in Practice<br />\n\u2022 Chapter 17: Ajax, RSS, SOAP and More", "name": "XML: Visual QuickStart Guide, 2nd Edition", "category": "XML"},

It covers its fundamental concepts and presents the many features that will boost your productivity when developing web applications. After introducing the key concepts and installing Composer, you will build a CRUD application and add more features to it in each successive chapter.\nThis book introduces you to a different and more enjoyable way of writing PHP applications. You will start by learning about the key principles and the same development practices that Laravel encourages. Then, in subsequent chapters, you will create and successively add more features to a web application.\nYou will learn how to use the arsenal of tools at your disposal and probably pick up some useful techniques along the way. Indeed, everything you will learn in this book is highly transferrable and applicable to other MVC frameworks. Laravel s routing mechanism, templating language, and object-relational mapper will have no more secrets for you. You will learn how to authenticate users, write tests, and create command line utilities that interact with your application with disconcerting ease.
