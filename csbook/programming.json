This easy-to-use tool boosts your productivity and is widely used in industry. So you ll be working like a pro right from the start.\nIt takes the mystery out of object-oriented programming by using real-world applications (instead of objects like cats and dogs) to demonstrate key concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.\nIt covers the most useful features introduced in Java SE 7, like the try-with-resources statement, the diamond operator (&lt;&gt;), and an improved file system API (known as NIO2).\nIn the GUI section, it shows you how to use the NetBeans Swing GUI builder to design a form and generate the code needed to display it. As a result, this section has you focus on critical coding skills, such as handling events, instead of on code that should be generated.\nBecause business applications routinely handle data, it shows how to work with text files, binary files, XML files, and databases (using JDBC).\nIt now has a chapter on deploying applications by using executable JAR files or Java Web Start.\nIt gives you the Java skills that you need to get started with Android programming.

It presents a methodology for conducting business case analysis that minimizes decision delay by focusing stakeholders on what matters most and suggests pathways for minimizing the risk in strategic and capital allocation decisions. Business case analysis, often conducted in spreadsheets, exposes decision makers to additional risks that arise just from the use of the spreadsheet environment.\nR has become one of the most widely used tools for reproducible quantitative analysis, and analysts fluent in this language are in high demand. The R language, traditionally used for statistical analysis, provides a more explicit, flexible, and extensible environment than spreadsheets for conducting business case analysis.\nThe main tutorial follows the case in which a chemical manufacturing company considers constructing a chemical reactor and production facility to bring a new compound to market. There are numerous uncertainties and risks involved, including the possibility that a competitor brings a similar product online. The company must determine the value of making the decision to move forward and where they might prioritize their attention to make a more informed and robust decision. While the example used is a chemical company, the analysis structure it presents can be applied to just about any business decision, from IT projects to new product development to commercial real estate.\u00a0The supporting tutorials include the perspective of the founder of a professional service firm who wants to grow his business and a member of a strategic planning group in a biomedical device company who wants to know how much to budget in order to refine the quality of information about critical uncertainties that might affect the value of a chosen product development pathway.\nWhat You\u2019ll LearnSet up a business case abstraction in an influence diagram to communicate the essence of the problem to other stakeholders\nModel the inherent uncertainties in the problem with Monte Carlo simulation using the R language\nCommunicate the results graphically\nDraw appropriate insights from the results\nDevelop creative decision strategies for thorough opportunity cost analysis\nCalculate the value of information on critical uncertainties between competing decision strategies to set the budget for deeper data analysis\nConstruct appropriate information to satisfy the parameters for the Monte Carlo simulation when little or no empirical data are availableWho This Book Is For\nFinancial analysts, data practitioners, and risk/business professionals; also appropriate for graduate level finance, business, or data science students", "name": "Business Case Analysis with R", "category": "Programming"},

You\u2019ll see how regexes are used for searching, parsing, and validation: in particular the grammar extension makes them uniquely suitable for parsing, the main focus of this book.Written by Perl 6 expert Moritz Lenz, a core contributor of Rakudo,\u00a0Parsing with Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars\u00a0starts from the very basics of regular expressions, and then explores how they integrate with regular Perl 6 code. Then follows a deeper exploration of how regexes work under the hood and a discussion of common techniques for constructing regexes and exploring the data under scrutiny. Later material goes beyond relatively simple formats to reusable named regexes and grammars, which permit code reuse in grammars, and shows how to write parsers for more involved data formats. Error reporting and case studies wrap up the topic.While regexes allow you to search for patterns in text and validate input, Perl 6 regexes advance that concept: you\u2019ll see how they are easier to read, yet much more powerful, than the traditionalPerl-compatible regular expression . With improved reusability and backtracking control, you will be able to write complete parsers with the help of this book.What You ll LearnDiscover the building blocks of Perl 6 regexes\nHandle regex mechanics and master useful regex techniques\nExtract data and work with patterns among these use cases\nReuse named regexes and other grammars as components or templates\nWrite full parsers, including advanced error reporting and data extraction\nLearn how to parse nested scopes and indention-based formatsWho This Book Is ForThose with at least some prior experience with Perl programming, but who may be new to Perl 6 as well as searching and parsing.", "name": "Parsing with Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars", "category": "Perl"},

Next, you will learn how to use the most important components of the Java 8 Concurrency API: the Executor framework to execute multiple tasks in your applications, the phaser class to implement concurrent tasks divided into phases, and the Fork/Join framework to implement concurrent tasks that can be split into smaller problems (using the divide and conquer technique). Toward the end, we will cover the new inclusions in Java 8 API, the Map and Reduce model, and the Map and Collect model. The book will also teach you about the data structures and synchronization utilities to avoid data-race conditions and other critical problems.

The book is heavy on coding exercises, but tries to stick to a common set of .NET patterns to ensure you walk away with understanding the different ways in which you can code for SharePoint. Moving from beginning to advanced means that you can expect the walkthroughs and chapters to become increasingly more complex within each chapter and throughout the book. The walkthroughs have been created to be concise and to guide you through all of the steps you must accomplish to complete a coding task.\nBeginning SharePoint 2010 Development\u00a0is aimed at the developer who is new to SharePoint. The book assumes you have some programming experience and a passion to learn how to develop for SharePoint. But this book does not assume that you ve programmed against SharePoint before. With regard to your general development background, the two assumptions in this book are that you have some familiarity with Web development, and you have an understanding of .NET programming. With regard to Web development, this book assumes that you understand HTML, and may have an understanding of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Extensible Markup Language/Extensible Stylesheet Language (XML/XSL), and dynamic languages such as JavaScript.

This in-depth tutorial goes beyond what is available anywhere else to teach how to write WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Phone applications using the Reactive Extensions (Rx) to handle events and asynchronous method calls.\nReactive programming allows you to turn those aspects of your code that are currently imperative into something much more event-driven and flexible. For this reason, it\u2019s sometimes referred to as LINQ for Events.\nReactive programming hinges on the concept of the observable collection, as opposed to the simple enumerable collection with which we\u2019re all familiar. For example, to extract data from a collection and add it to a list box, you would traditionally iterate through the list box, extracting each object in turn. This approach works fine, but it requires significant knowledge about the data you\u2019re working with, which can be limiting. In Rx programming, you re instead informed about each object in turn and then free to react to each notification however you like, which affords much greater flexibility.\nThis book shows you how reactive programming can be applied to a range of situations\u2014from WPF applications to Windows Phone apps\u2014to improve coding efficiency and boost performance.", "name": "Programming Reactive Extensions and LINQ", "category": ".NET"},

It was not long after that he discovered Elixir, which sits on top of the Erlang virtual machine and has features more palatable for non-functional programmers, although it is a functional programming language itself.Erlang and Elixir for Imperative Programmers gives you a basis for deciding whether the effort is viable for your next project.

The release of Xamarin changed all of that, and with it brought cross-platform development to the mobile world.\nXamarin Mobile Application Development for iOS is not just your normal everyday book on iOS app development. Everything is written for a point and not for effect, and therefore you will learn everything you need to know quickly and efficiently without getting bogged down in needless information. The code has been taken from fully tested apps, so you can just drop it into your code and it will work out of the box.\nIn this clear and informative guide, you will be taken on a whirlwind tour of iOS application development with Xamarin, from setting up a development environment on your PC or Mac to testing and distribution through the Apple Store with plenty of practical examples along the way.\nThe book begins by discussing the installation of the IDE (for both PC and Mac) as well as how to set up your PC so it can be used to develop for iOS. From there, successive chapters cover the user interface, views, view controllers, customisation of controls, animation, events and event handling, getting the most from your app using threading, creating your own settings system, the internal database system and LINQ, sending texts, making calls, taking photos, videos, and audio recordings as well as using the mapping system. The book culminates by showing you how to test your app using testflight and finally how to release your app on the Apple Store. It is an all-encompassing book that leaves nothing out.\nWhat you will learn from this bookCreate a working user interface\nUnderstand and write a cross-platform configuration system\nLearn how to create an SQLite helper system and master the basics of LINQ\nUse and manipulate graphics\nGet the most out of your iOS device with very little code\nPublish your very own app on Apple\u2019s app store\nCome to terms with threading in a mobile world", "name": "Xamarin Mobile Application Development for iOS", "category": "C#"},

This book shows how a holistic and set-oriented approach to database programming can far exceed the performance of the row-by-row model that is too often used by developers who haven\u2019t been shown a better way.\nTwo styles of programming are encountered in the database world. Classical programming as taught in many universities leads to an atomic, row-oriented, and procedural style inspired by the structured models of programming. In short, many application developers write in the relational database exactly like in the user interface. The other style of programming is holistic, data set oriented, and coded mainly in SQL. This is the style of the database developer.\nThe set based and holistic style of development is not promoted enough in universities, and many application developers are not fully aware of it. There are many performance issues all over the world in relational databases due to the use of the atomic and inappropriate style of programming. This book compares the two styles, and promotes the holistic style of development as the most suitable one.

Almost every concept has an R code going with it which exemplifies the strength of R and applications. Thus, the reader first understands the data characteristics, descriptive statistics, and the exploratory attitude which gives the first firm footing of data analysis. Statistical inference and the use of simulation which makes use of the computational power complete the technical footing of statistical methods. Regression modeling, linear, logistic, and CART, builds the essential toolkit which helps the reader complete complex problems in the real world.\nThe reader will begin with a brief understanding of the nature of data and end with modern and advanced statistical models like CART. Every step is taken with DATA and R code.\nThe data analysis journey begins with exploratory analysis, which is more than simple descriptive data summaries, and then takes the traditional path up to linear regression modeling, and ends with logistic regression, CART, and spatial statistics.\nTrue to the title R Statistical Application Development by Example Beginner\u2019s Guide, the reader will enjoy the examples and R software.", "name": "R Statistical Application Development by Example Beginner&#8217;s Guide", "category": "Programming"},

Until the open source MonoTouch project, this field was limited to those familiar with Apple s programming languages. Now .NET and C# developers can join the party. Professional iPhone Programming with MonoTouch and .NET/C# is the first book to cover MonoTouch, preparing developers to take advantage of this lucrative opportunity. This book is for .NET developers that are interested in creating native iPhone applications written in .NET/C#. These developers want to use their existing knowledge. While .NET developers are always interested in learning, they also recognize that learning Objective-C and the specifics of the iPhone can be overwhelming. Those developers interested in MonoTouch will recognize that the cost of MonoTouch is easily made up by the ability to quickly target the iPhone using a language that they are already familiar with. This book is designed for .NET developers that want to target the iPhone. It is designed to help you get up to speed with the iPhone, not to really teach you about the .N ET Framework or C# language, which we assume you already know. This book is designed with introductory material in Chapters 1 thru 4. You should read Chapters 1 thru 4 sequentially. These chapters introduce the MonoTouch product, the basics of developing with MonoTouch and MonoDevelop, and finally, the basics of presenting data to a user with screen and data controls and how to develop a user interface for the iPhone. Once you are comfortable with these concepts, you can typically move from one chapter to another and not necessarily have to read the chapters sequentially. Chapter 1Introduction to iPhone Development with MonoTouch for C# DevelopersThis chapter looks at how the largest segment of developers can target the smartphone with the highest mindshare, and that the smartphone is growing faster in marketshare than any other device. Chapter 2Introduction to MonoTouchgives you a firm foundation in MonoTouch, MonoDevelop, Interface Builder, debugging, and deploying. Chapter 3Planning Your App s UI: Exploring the Screen Controlsteaches you about creating your application s UI and specifically how the UI on the iPhone can differ from UIs that you might have created before. You also explore the Input &amp; Value objects from the Interface Builder Objects Library. Chapter4Data Controlsshows the Interface Builder Objects Library Cocoa Touch classes for Controllers, Data Views, and Windows, Views, &amp; Bars. Chapter 5Working with Data on the iPhonelooks at the SQLite database engine as well as strategies to store data off the device on a central server through SOAP and REST (using XML and JSON) without tying up the user interface. Chapter 6Displaying Data Using Tableslooks at displaying information in a table, using tables for navigation, taking advantage of UITableView s built-in editing features, and adding a search bar to a table. Chapter 7Mappingcovers CoreLocation and MapKit, using Location Services, and adding maps and geocoding to your application. Chapter 8Application Settingsfocuses on application settings, and looks at two aspects of settings for your MonoTouch app: the Info.plist and your settings bundle. It covers what settings you might want to set in your Info.plist and why, and then looks at what code it takes to read and use the settings that you save in the settings bundle. And it also takes you through the building of the settings that you might have in a social media-type application. Going through each step, you will examine the Root.plist inside the Property List Editor and see the settings dialog that will result from it. Chapter 9Programming with Device Hardwarecovers accelerometer device orientation, and proximity detection support, networking, and developing with battery life in mind. Chapter 10Programming with Multimediadiscussing integrating images and the image picker, watching and recording videos, playing and recording audio, and using animation Chapter 11Talking to Other Applicationsdiscusses the ways you can use MonoTouch to talk to other applications on the iPhone, both Apple-built applications and those downloaded from the App Store. It also provides helpful ways of accessing the iPhone s Address Book and the iPod music library. Chapter 12Localizing for an International Audiencefirst defines internationalization and localization, then shows displaying translated text and images, formatting dates, times, and numbers, then extracting text for translation. Chapter 13Programming the iPadthe capabilities of the iPad are, what new APIs and controls have been introduced that you can use in iPad-specific applications, and how to build applications that can work on both iPad and iPhone devices. Chapter 14Just Enough Objective-Cprovides you with a reference and introduction to Objective-C that will help you acquire an ability to comprehend Objective-C which is something that will come in very handy. Chapter 15The App Store: Submitting and Marketing Your Appdiscusses all things App Store. First, it talks about the process that you need to go through before you are ready to submitthis includes final testing with Ad-Hoc builds and a presubmission checklist. Next it addresses actually submitting to the App Store, and then finally what to do with your app after it s in the App Store.

You don t need to know REST, as we cover the theory of REST and web services; however, you should be familiar with the Java language and have some understanding of Java web applications.

It combines logical business principles and strategies with a step-by-step methodology for planning and modeling a company and solving specific business problems. You\u2019ll learn to create operational and financial models in Excel that describe the workings of your company in quantitative terms and that make it far more likely you will avoid the traps and dead ends many businesses fall into.\nSerial entrepreneur and financial expert Tom Y. Sawyer shows how to break your company down into basic functional and operational components that can be modeled. The result is a financial model that, for example, you can literally take to the bank or bring to local angel investors to receive the funding you need to launch your business or a new product. Or it might be a model that shows with startling clarity that your new product development effort is a likely winner\u2014or loser. Even better, you\u2019ll learn to create models that will serve as guideposts for ongoing operations. You\u2019ll always know just where you are financially, and where you need to be. The models you will learn to build in Financial Modeling for Business Owners and Entrepreneurs can be used to:\nRaise capital for startup or any stage of growth<br />\nPlan projects and new initiatives<br />\nMake astute business decisions, including go/no-go assessments<br />\nAnalyze ROI on your product development and marketing expenditures<br />\nStreamline operations, manage budgets, improve efficiency, and reduce costs<br />\nValue the business when it is time to cash out or merge<br />\nIn addition to many valuable exercises and tips for using Excel to model your business, this book contains a combination of practical advice born of hard-won lessons, advanced strategic thought, and the insightful use of hard skills. With a basic knowledge of Excel assumed, it will help you learn to think like an experienced business person who expects to make money on the products or services offered to the public. You\u2019ll discover that the financial model is a key management tool that, if built correctly, provides invaluable assistance every step of the entrepreneurial journey.\nTom Y. Sawyer has used the principles this book contains to create financial models of numerous startup and early-stage companies, assisting them in planning for and raising the capital that they needed to grow their businesses and ultimately exit with multiples of their initial investment. Financial Modeling for Business Owners and Entrepreneurs, a mini-MBA in entrepreneurship and finance, will show you how you can do the same.\nNote: This book is an updated version of Sawyer s 2009 title, Pro Excel Financial Modeling.", "name": "Financial Modeling for Business Owners and Entrepreneurs", "category": "C#"},

It is divided into three parts plus several appendices. Part I provides a foundation for real-time C++ by covering language technologies, including object-oriented methods, template programming and optimization. Next, part II presents detailed descriptions of a variety of C++ components that are widely used in microcontroller programming. It details some of C++\u2019s most powerful language elements, such as class types, templates and the STL, to develop components for microcontroller register access, low-level drivers, custom memory management, embedded containers, multitasking, etc. Finally, part III describes mathematical methods and generic utilities that can be employed to solve recurring problems in real-time C++. The appendices include a brief C++ language tutorial, information on the real-time C++ development environment and instructions for building GNU GCC cross-compilers and a microcontroller circuit.\nFor this second edition, the most recent specification of C++14 in ISO/IEC 14882:2014 is used throughout the text. Several sections on new C++14 functionality have been added, and various others reworked to reflect changes in the standard. Also two new sample projects are introduced, and various user suggestions have been incorporated. To facilitate portability, no libraries other than those specified in the language standard itself are used. Efficiency is always in focus and numerous examples are backed up with real-time performance measurements and size analyses that quantify the true costs of the code down to the very last byte and microsecond.\nThe target audience of this book mainly consists of students and professionals interested in real-time C++. Readers should be familiar with C or another programming language and will benefit most if they have had some previous experience with microcontroller electronics and the performance and size issues prevalent in embedded systems programming.", "name": "Real-Time C++, 2nd Edition", "category": "C &amp; C++"},

With its unique blend of forensic psychology and code analysis, this book arms you with the strategies you need, no matter what programming language you use.\nSoftware is a living entity that s constantly changing. To understand software systems, we need to know where they came from and how they evolved. By mining commit data and analyzing the history of your code, you can start fixes ahead of time to eliminate broken designs, maintenance issues, and team productivity bottlenecks.\nIn this book, you ll learn forensic psychology techniques to successfully maintain your software. You ll create a geographic profile from your commit data to find hotspots, and apply temporal coupling concepts to uncover hidden relationships between unrelated areas in your code. You ll also measure the effectiveness of your code improvements. You ll learn how to apply these techniques on projects both large and small. For small projects, you ll get new insights into your design and how well the code fits your ideas. For large projects, you ll identify the good and the fragile parts.\nLarge-scale development is also a social activity, and the team s dynamics influence code quality. That s why this book shows you how to uncover social biases when analyzing the evolution of your system. You ll use commit messages as eyewitness accounts to what is really happening in your code. Finally, you ll put it all together by tracking organizational problems in the code and finding out how to fix them.

Other features are taken from more dynamic Scripting languages as well as from Functional languages. It is a language, a complier, and a framework of classes designed to help developers write clean code. It opens up the world of application development and reduces the learning curve while minimizing potential roadblocks. It is difficult to write a book on haXe because there are so many possibilities that the language can provide. It is able to target three platforms: JavaScript, Flash, and Neko. It opens a lot of doors for web developers. The combination of these different technologies makes it possible to create things today that were hard to imagine yesterday. haXe makes it possible to develop applications targeting multiple platforms very quickly. Neko is a cross-platform virtual machine and it acts as one of the targets of the haXe complier. It is lightweight, fast, and flexible. It can be embedded and requires a small footprint that makes it practically invisible. When combined with haXe, it can open a lot of doors to pure web development (e.g., real-time servers and console and desktop applications). This book is for web developers who would like to work with a unified environment while at the same time reducing the number of languages required to produce a single software solution. Although you don t have to be a veteran programmer to utilize the information in this book, it helps if you have already programmed in ActionScript, Java, or another ECMA standard language. The material in this book is split into three parts based on the content that each part is discussing. The first part of the book focuses mainly on the basics of the haXe programming language. Details are given about the language structure, standard libraries, and programming practices. If you are an experienced haXe programmer you can probably skip this section. Those who are familiar with programming but are new to haXe can go through the first section easily and look mainly at the code examples and tables that detail the classes and commands required to develop in haXe. The second part of the book covers the practical uses of haXe, including the production of Flash movies and dynamic content for websites. This part is useful to programmers of any skill level. This section also contains references to platform-specific classes defined in the standard library (the core framework that comes with the haXe base installation). The third part of the book is dedicated to the advanced developer who wants to use haXe for all it has to offer.

A wide variety of problems in artificial intelligence are solved using the constraint satisfaction problem paradigm. However, there are several applications in multi-agent coordination that are of a distributed nature. In this type of application, the knowledge about the problem, that is, variables and constraints, may be logically or geographically distributed among physical distributed agents. This distribution is mainly due to privacy and/or security requirements. Therefore, a distributed model allowing a decentralized solving process is more adequate to model and solve such kinds of problem. The distributed constraint satisfaction problem has such properties.

Demand for parallelizing learning algorithms is highly task-specific: in some settings it is driven by the enormous dataset sizes, in others by model complexity or by real-time performance requirements. Making task-appropriate algorithm and platform choices for large-scale machine learning requires understanding the benefits, trade-offs, and constraints of the available options. Solutions presented in the book cover a range of parallelization platforms from FPGAs and GPUs to multi-core systems and commodity clusters, concurrent programming frameworks including CUDA, MPI, MapReduce, and DryadLINQ, and learning settings (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and online learning). Extensive coverage of parallelization of boosted trees, SVMs, spectral clustering, belief propagation and other popular learning algorithms and deep dives into several applications make the book equally useful for researchers, students, and practitioners.", "name": "Scaling up Machine Learning", "category": "Algorithms"},

He explains how to use algorithms for sorting, searching, numerical analysis, data compression, data encryption, common graph problems, and computational geometry. And he describes the relative efficiency of all implementations.

However, this one is exceptional to certain extent. The whole textbook is designed as a record of the dialogue of the author with his daughter who wants to learn programming. The author endeavors not to explain the Java programming language to the readers, but to teach them real programming. To teach them how to think and design the program as the experienced programmers do. Entire matter is explained in a very illustrative way which means even a current secondary school student can understand it quite simply. The book comes out of the author s long-term experience with teaching children, university students as well as professional programmers. The author teaches programming according to the Architecture First methodology which reacts at the companiescomplaints that the school graduates are usually good in coding, but bad in software architecture. Coding itself is gradually taken over by various code-generators, but the work of the architect will stay irreplaceable for a long time. The author pursues the pedagogical principle saying that those items considered as the most important should be presented as soon as possible. Therefore he leads the readers to apply the proper design of the architecture of the created program and to avoid common mistakes since the very beginning. For designing the programs, the development environment BlueJ is used, which is proposed specially for the beginners and which enables explaining, demonstrating and programming a number of basic architectonic constructs without leaving the architectonic level and degrading to the code level. The book is divided into three parts. The first one deals with the explanation of basic constructs of the object oriented programming and all proposed programs are created by the code-generator incorporated in BlueJ. The second part repeats the explained constructs and the readers can learn how to code the proposed program similarly as was done by the generator in the first part. The third part presents constructs which are beyond the bounds of abilities of the used code-generator, and therefore the readers have to program them themselves. Despite that, the explanation core keeps in the level of architecture. The book is determined above all for complete beginners. However, the experience proved that even the intermediate programmers can find a lot of interesting and informative in it.", "name": "OOP &#8211; Learn Object Oriented Thinking and Programming", "category": "Java"},

The methodologies offered here extend to the target semantic and pragmatic analyses of computational natural language interpretation. Bayesian approaches to natural language semantics and pragmatics are based on methods from signal processing and the causal Bayesian models pioneered by especially Pearl. In signal processing, the Bayesian method finds the most probable interpretation by finding the one that maximizes the product of the prior probability and the likelihood of the interpretation.

It combines model-driven engineering and the aspect-oriented paradigm to integrate security practices into the early phases of the software development process. To this end, a UML profile has been developed for the specification of security hardening aspects on UML diagrams. In addition, a weaving framework, with the underlying theoretical foundations, has been designed for the systematic injection of security aspects into UML models.\nThe work is organized as follows: chapter 1 presents an introduction to software security, model-driven engineering, UML and aspect-oriented technologies. Chapters 2 and 3 provide an overview of UML language and the main concepts of aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) respectively. Chapter 4 explores the area of model-driven architecture with a focus on model transformations. The main approaches that are adopted in the literature for security specification and hardening are presented in chapter 5. After these more general presentations, chapter 6 introduces the AOM profile for security aspects specification. Afterwards, chapter 7 details the design and the implementation of the security weaving framework, including several real-life case studies to illustrate its applicability. Chapter 8 elaborates an operational semantics for the matching/weaving processes in activity diagrams, while chapters 9 and 10 present a denotational semantics for aspect matching and weaving in executable models following a continuation-passing style. Finally, a summary and evaluation of the work presented are provided in chapter 11.<br />\nThe book will benefit researchers in academia and industry as well as students interested in learning about recent research advances in the field of software security engineering.", "name": "Aspect-Oriented Security Hardening of UML Design Models", "category": "Programming"},

The book discusses how in implicit processing approach, excitation source features are derived from LP residual, Hilbert envelope (magnitude) of LP residual and Phase of LP residual; and in explicit parameterization approach, LP residual signal is processed in spectral domain to extract the relevant language specific features. The authors further extract source features from these modes, which are combined for enhancing the performance of LID systems. The proposed excitation source features are also investigated for LID in background noisy environments. Each chapter of this book provides the motivation for exploring the specific feature for LID task, and subsequently discuss the methods to extract those features and finally suggest appropriate models to capture the language specific knowledge from the proposed features.

MyBatis takes the simplest approach of leveraging the existing knowledge and power of Java and SQL yet provides powerful features to make data persistence implementation easy. Java Persistence with MyBatis 3 is a practical, hands-on guide that provides you with a number of clear step-by-step exercises, which will help you to understand how MyBatis works and how to use it for your real application needs.", "name": "Java Persistence with MyBatis 3", "category": "Java"},

Servlets are most commonly used, however, to extend Web servers, performing tasks traditionally handled by CGI programs. Web servers that can support servlets include: Apache, Netscape s FastTrack and Enterprise Servers, Microsoft s IIS, O Reilly s WebSite, and JavaSoft s Java Web Server.", "name": "Java Servlet Programming", "category": "Java"},

The concept of this book is exactly that \u2013 to get you using the framework and writing code immediately. You will be off and running in no time, and adding to your skill set as we progress.\nThis book is written with exactly that learning method in mind. No filler, no empty explanationsjust code. You won t be driving solo, however. Each code example is heavily annotated with comments and tips, so that you not only understand each snippet, but can also dive deeper if you so choose.\nStripes is a web framework for the Java programming language. It was initially released in 2005 by Tim Fennell. Despite its growth and maturity, Stripes has always focused on two key principles: simplicity and ease of development. Stripes has also remained a solution for a single application tier: the web-layer. Its purpose is to handle the interaction between a web browser and server-side java code. To tie these concepts together Stripes makes heavy use of Java annotations, which we will see as we learn the various features of Stripes.", "name": "Stripes by Example", "category": "Java"},
