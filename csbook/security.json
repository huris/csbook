    "description": "Discover the most prevalent cyber threats against individual users of all kinds of computing devices. This book teaches you the defensive best practices and state-of-the-art tools available to you to repel each kind of threat.\nPersonal Cybersecurity addresses the needs of individual users at work and at home. This book covers personal cybersecurity for all modes of personal computing whether on consumer-acquired or company-issued devices: desktop PCs, laptops, mobile devices, smart TVs, WiFi and Bluetooth peripherals, and IoT objects embedded with network-connected sensors. In all these modes, the frequency, intensity, and sophistication of cyberattacks that put individual users at risk are increasing in step with accelerating mutation rates of malware and cybercriminal delivery systems.\nTraditional anti-virus software and personal firewalls no longer suffice to guarantee personal security. Users who neglect to learn and adopt the new ways of protecting themselves in their work and private environments put themselves, their associates, and their companies at risk of inconvenience, violation, reputational damage, data corruption, data theft, system degradation, system destruction, financial harm, and criminal disaster. This book shows what actions to take to limit the harm and recover from the damage.\nInstead of laying down a code ofthou shalt notrules that admit of too many exceptions and contingencies to be of much practical use, cloud expert Marvin Waschke equips you with the battlefield intelligence, strategic understanding, survival training, and proven tools you need to intelligently assess the security threats in your environment and most effectively secure yourself from attacks. Through instructive examples and scenarios, the author shows you how to adapt and apply best practices to your own particular circumstances, how to automate and routinize your personal cybersecurity, how to recognize security breaches and act swiftly to seal them, and how to recover losses and restore functionality when attacks succeed.\nWhat You ll LearnDiscover how computer security works and what it can protect us from\nSee how a typical hacker attack worksEvaluate computer security threats to the individual user and corporate systemsIdentify the critical vulnerabilities of a computer connected to the Internet\nManage your computer to reduce vulnerabilities to yourself and your employer\nDiscover how the adoption of newer forms of biometric authentication affects you\nStop your router and other online devices from being co-opted into disruptive denial of service attacksWho This Book Is ForProficient and technically knowledgeable computer users who are anxious about cybercrime and want to understand the technology behind both attack and defense but do not want to go so far as to become security experts. Some of this audience will be purely home users, but many will be executives, technical managers, developers, and members of IT departments who need to adopt personal practices for their own safety and the protection of corporate systems. Many will want to impart good cybersecurity practices to their colleagues. IT departments tasked with indoctrinating their users with good safety practices may use the book as training material.",

    "description": "This book is a wake-up call explaining how to detect and prevent the hacking of medical equipment at hospitals and healthcare facilities. The vulnerability of the medical equipment inside the hospital to cyber-attacks far eclipses the actual building equipment. A cyber-physical attack on building equipment pales in comparison to the damage a determined hacker can do if he/she gains access to a medical grade network. A medical grade network controls the diagnostic, treatment and life support equipment on which lives depend.\nRecent news reports how hackers struck hospitals with ransomware that prevented staff from accessing patient records or scheduling appointments. Unfortunately, medical equipment can also be hacked and shut down remotely as a form of extortion. Criminal hackers will not ask for a $500 payment to unlock an MRI, PET, CT Scan, or X-Ray machine\u2014they will ask for much more.\nLitigation is bound to follow and the resulting punitive awards will drive up hospital insurance costs and healthcare costs in general. This will undoubtedly result in increased regulations for hospitals and higher costs for compliance. Unless hospitals and other healthcare facilities take the steps necessary now to secure their medical grade networks, they will be targeted for cyber-physical attack, possibly with life-threatening consequences.\nCybersecurity for Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities shows what hackers can do, why hackers would target a hospital, the way they research a target, ways they can gain access to a medical grade network (cyber-attack vectors), and ways they hope to monetize their cyber-attack. By understanding and detecting the threats, hospital administrators can take action now \u2013 before their hospital becomes the next victim.\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1: Hacker Reconnaissance of a Hospital Network<br />\nChapter 2: How Hackers Gain Access to a Healthcare Facility or Hospital Network<br />\nChapter 3: Active Medical Device Cyber-Attacks<br />\nChapter 4: Medical Facility Cyber-Physical Attacks<br />\nChapter 5: Hospital Insider Threat<br />\nChapter 6: Detection of Cyber-Attacks<br />\nChapter 7: Preventing Cyber-Attacks<br />\nChapter 8: Cyber-Attack Response and Recovery Planning<br />\nChapter 9: Appendix.

However, when published data refer to individual respondents, disclosure risk limitation techniques must be implemented to anonymize the data and guarantee by design the fundamental right to privacy of the subjects the data refer to. Disclosure risk limitation has a long record in the statistical and computer science research communities, who have developed a variety of privacy-preserving solutions for data releases. This Synthesis Lecture provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of privacy in data releases focusing on the computer science perspective. Specifically, we detail the privacy models, anonymization methods, and utility and risk metrics that have been proposed so far in the literature. Besides, as a more advanced topic, we identify and discuss in detail connections between several privacy models (i.e., how to accumulate the privacy guarantees they offer to achieve more robust protection and when such guarantees are equivalent or complementary); we also explore the links between anonymization methods and privacy models (how anonymization methods can be used to enforce privacy models and thereby offer ex ante privacy guarantees). These latter topics are relevant to researchers and advanced practitioners, who will gain a deeper understanding on the available data anonymization solutions and the privacy guarantees they can offer.",

It explains the Mobile Healthcare Network (MHN) architecture and its diverse applications, and reviews the existing works on security and privacy for MHNs. Critical future challenges and research problems are also identified.\nUsing a Quality-of-Protection perspective, the authors provide valuable insights on security and privacy preservation for MHNs. Some promising solutions are proposed to accommodate the issues of secure health data transmission, misbehavior detection, health data processing with privacy preservation and access control in MHNs. Specifically, the secure health data aggregation explores social spots to help forward health data and enable users to select the optimal relay according to their social ties and health data priority. The secure aggregation achieves the desirable delivery ratio with reasonable communication costs and lower delay for the data in different priorities.\nA proposed misbehavior detection scheme distinguishes Sybil attackers from normal users by comparing their mobile contacts and pseudonym changing behaviors. The detection accuracy is high enough to resist various Sybil attacks including forgery. In addition, the health data processing scheme can analyze the encrypted health data and preserve user\u2019s privacy at the same time. Attribute based access control can achieve fine-grained acces\ns control with user-defined access policy in MHNs.<br />\nSecurity and Privacy for Mobile Healthcare Networks is designed for researchers and advanced-level students interested in healthcare security and secure data transmission.",

Given sufficient time, an intelligent attacker can eventually defeat defensive measures protecting an enterprise\u2019s computer systems and IT networks.\nTo prevail, an enterprise cybersecurity program must manage risk by detecting attacks early enough and delaying them long enough that the defenders have time to respond effectively. Enterprise Cybersecurity shows players at all levels of responsibility how to unify their organization\u2019s people, budgets, technologies, and processes into a cost-efficient cybersecurity program capable of countering advanced cyberattacks and containing damage in the event of a breach.\nThe authors of Enterprise Cybersecurity explain at both strategic and tactical levels how to accomplish the mission of leading, designing, deploying, operating, managing, and supporting cybersecurity capabilities in an enterprise environment. The authors are recognized experts and thought leaders in this rapidly evolving field, drawing on decades of collective experience in cybersecurity and IT. In capacities ranging from executive strategist to systems architect to cybercombatant, Scott E. Donaldson, Stanley G. Siegel, Chris K. Williams, and Abdul Aslam have fought on the front lines of cybersecurity against advanced persistent threats to government, military, and business entities.",

    "description": "There is increasing pressure to protect computer networks against unauthorized intrusion, and some work in this area is concerned with engineering systems that are robust to attack. However, no system can be made invulnerable. Data Analysis for Network Cyber-Security focuses on monitoring and analyzing network traffic data, with the intention of preventing, or quickly identifying, malicious activity.<br />\nSuch work involves the intersection of statistics, data mining and computer science. Fundamentally, network traffic is relational, embodying a link between devices. As such, graph analysis approaches are a natural candidate. However, such methods do not scale well to the demands of real problems, and the critical aspect of the timing of communications events is not accounted for in these approaches.\nThis book gathers papers from leading researchers to provide both background to the problems and a description of cutting-edge methodology. The contributors are from diverse institutions and areas of expertise and were brought together at a workshop held at the University of Bristol in March 2013 to address the issues of network cyber security. The workshop was supported by the Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research.\nReadership: Researchers and graduate students in the fields of network traffic data analysis and network cyber security.",
