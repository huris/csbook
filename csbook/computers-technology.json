Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP.\nIt is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse\u2013but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language (such as Objective-C, VB .NET, C++, C# .NET, or Java) or a modeling language (such as UML), and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls \u201cthe object-oriented thought process.\u201d\nWritten by a developer for developers who want to make the leap to object-oriented technologies,\u00a0The Object-Oriented Thought Process\u00a0provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations.\nWhile programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant\u2013no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on interoperability across programming technologies, whether you are using objects in traditional application design, in XML-based data transactions, in web page development, in mobile apps, or in any modern programming environment.\n\u201cProgrammers who aim to create high quality software\u2013as all programmers should\u2013must learn the varied subtleties of the familiar yet not so familiar beasts called objects and classes. Doing so entails careful study of books such as Matt Weisfeld\u2019s\u00a0The Object-Oriented Thought Process.\u201d\n\u2013Bill McCarty, author of Java Distributed Objects, and Object-Oriented Design in Java\nContents at a Glance\n1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts<br />\n2 How to Think in Terms of Objects<br />\n3 Advanced Object-Oriented Concepts<br />\n4 The Anatomy of a Class<br />\n5 Class Design Guidelines<br />\n6 Designing with Objects<br />\n7 Mastering Inheritance and Composition<br />\n8 Frameworks and Reuse: Designing with Interfaces and Abstract Classes<br />\n9 Building Objects and Object-Oriented Design<br />\n10 Creating Object Models<br />\n11 Objects and Portable Data: XML and JSON<br />\n12 Persistent Objects: Serialization, Marshaling, and Relational Databases<br />\n13 Objects in Web Services, Mobile Apps, and Hybrids<br />\n14 Objects and Client/Server Applications<br />\n15 Design Patterns",

This concise book presents a set of API design rules, drawn primarily from best practices that stick close to the Web\u2019s REST architectural style. Along with rules for URI design and HTTP use, you\u2019ll learn guidelines for media types and representational forms.\nREST APIs are ubiquitous, but few of them follow a consistent design methodology. Using these simple rules, you will design web service APIs that adhere to recognized web standards. To assist you, author Mark Mass\u00e9 introduces the Web Resource Modeling Language (WRML), a conceptual framework he created for the design and implementation of REST APIs.Learn design rules for addressing resources with URIs\nApply design principles to HTTP\u2019s request methods and response status codes\nWork with guidelines for conveying metadata through HTTP headers and media types\nGet design tips to address the needs of client programs, including the special needs of browser-based JavaScript clients\nUnderstand why REST APIs should be designed and configured, not coded",

    "description": "This book introduces the Vienna Simulator Suite for 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compatible Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) simulators and presents applications to demonstrate their uses for describing, designing, and optimizing wireless cellular LTE-A networks.\nPart One addresses LTE and LTE-A link level techniques. As there has been high demand for the downlink (DL) simulator, it constitutes the central focus of the majority of the chapters. This part of the book reports on relevant highlights, including single-user (SU), multi-user (MU) and single-input-single-output (SISO) as well as multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions. Furthermore, it summarizes the optimal pilot pattern for high-speed communications as well as different synchronization issues. One chapter is devoted to experiments that show how the link level simulator can provide input to a testbed. This section also uses measurements to present and validate fundamental results on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions that are not limited to LTE-A. One chapter exclusively deals with the newest tool, the uplink (UL) link level simulator, and presents cutting-edge results.\nIn turn, Part Two focuses on system-level simulations. From early on, system-level simulations have been in high demand, as people are naturally seeking answers when scenarios with numerous base stations and hundreds of users are investigated. This part not only explains how mathematical abstraction can be employed to speed up simulations by several hundred times without sacrificing precision, but also illustrates new theories on how to abstract large urban heterogeneous networks with indoor small cells. It also reports on advanced applications such as train and car transmissions to demonstrate the tools\u2019 capabilities.\n&nbsp;",

Identifying the wants, needs, and knowledge of internet users can be like listening to a mob.\nIn the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to market dominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles-the collective intelligence locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.\nCollective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.\nThis book is for Java developers implementing Collective Intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.\nAlong the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

    "description": "A fascinating conversation with one of the most far-sighted thinkers in technology. Assange is consistently ahead of the curve.-Edward Snowden Assange has one of the sharpest technological brains there is; the Schmidt transcript demonstrates how much stronger his grasp of the web is than even Google s executive chairman.-Rosie Kinchen, The Sunday Times (London)In June 2011, Julian Assange received an unusual visitor: the chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, arrived from America at Ellingham Hall, the country residence in Norfolk, England where Assange was living under house arrest.For several hours the besieged leader of the world s most famous insurgent publishing organization and the billionaire head of the world s largest information empire locked horns. The two men debated the political problems faced by society, and the technological solutions engendered by the global network-from the Arab Spring to Bitcoin. They outlined radically opposing perspectives: for Assange, the liberating power of the Internet is based on its freedom and statelessness. For Schmidt, emancipation is at one with US foreign policy objectives and is driven by connecting non-Western countries to American companies and markets. These differences embodied a tug-of-war over the Internet s future that has only gathered force subsequently.When Google Met WikiLeaks presents the story of Assange and Schmidt s encounter. Both fascinating and alarming, it contains an edited transcript of their conversation and extensive, new material, written by Assange specifically for this book, providing the best available summary of his vision for the future of the Internet.",

Mathematics can be fun, exciting, surprising, and stunningly beautiful. But too few people ever experience this, associating it instead with boring and apparently pointless exercises in trigonometry and solving equations. This guide will take you on an emotional journey, starting from very simple ideas, and exploring some surprising and intricately beautiful behaviors of the very simple mathematics that underlies the famous Mandelbrot fractal. You won t need anything more than basic school mathematics. Part 1 is about ideas. It introduces the mathematical ideas underlying the Mandelbrot fractal, gently with lots of illustrations and examples. Part 2 is practical. It introduces the popular and easy to learn Python programming language, and gradually builds up a program to calculate and visualise the Mandelbrot fractal. Part 3 extends these ideas. It reveals the related Julia fractals, creates 3-dimensional landscapes and shows how even more interesting images can be made using mathematical filters. The fractal image on the cover of this book is created using only the ideas and code developed in this book.",

    "description": "Data accumulated about customers, products, and website users can not only help interpret the past, it can help predict the future! Probabilistic programming is a programming paradigm in which code models are used to draw probabilistic inferences from data. By applying specialized algorithms, programs assign degrees of probability to conclusions and make it possible to forecast future events like sales trends, computer system failures, experimental outcomes, and other critical concerns.\nPractical Probabilistic Programming explains how to use the PP paradigm to model application domains and express those probabilistic models in code. It shows how to use the Figaro language to build a spam filter and apply Bayesian and Markov networks to diagnose computer system data problems and recover digital images. Then it dives into the world of probabilistic inference, where algorithms help turn the extended prediction of social media usage into a science. The book covers functional-style programming for text analysis and using object-oriented models to predict social phenomena like the spread of tweets, and using open universe models to model real-life social media usage. It also teaches the principles of algorithms such as belief propagation and Markov chain Monte Carlo. The book closes out with modeling dynamic systems by using a product cycle as its main example and explains how probabilistic models can help in the decision-making process for an ad campaign.",

First, the architecture and applications are provided. Then, the authors review the existing works on charging and discharging strategy design for EVs. Critical challenges and research problems are identified. Promising solutions are proposed to accommodate the issues of high EV mobility, vehicle range anxiety, and power systems overload.\nThe authors investigate innovating charging and discharging potentials for mobile EVS based on real-time information collections (via VANETS and/or cellular networks) and offer the power system adjustable load management methods. Several innovative charging/discharging strategy designs to address the challenging issues in smart grid, i.e., overload avoidance and range anxiety for individual EVs, are presented. This book presents an alternative and promising way to release the pressure of the power grid caused by peak-time EV charging demand.\nMobile Electric Vehicles: Online Charging and Discharging provides valuable insights on charging/ discharging strategy design for mobile EVs and the power system management in a smart grid. The authors\u2019 findings indicate that the proposed strategies considerably outperform the traditional EV charging strategies without real-time collections on the metrics of the overall energy utilizat\nion, the average EV travel cost and the number of successfully charged EVs. Research and graduate students who are working on smart grid and vehicular communication will find this book a valuable resource. Customs and systems operators will also find this book useful.",

    "price": 172,
    "description": "This book provides a tutorial introduction to modern techniques for representing and reasoning about qualitative preferences with respect to a set of alternatives. The syntax and semantics of several languages for representing preference languages, including CP-nets, TCP-nets, CI-nets, and CP-theories, are reviewed. Some key problems in reasoning about preferences are introduced, including determining whether one alternative is preferred to another, or whether they are equivalent, with respect to a given set of preferences. These tasks can be reduced to model checking in temporal logic. Specifically, an induced preference graph that represents a given set of preferences can be efficiently encoded using a Kripke Structure for Computational Tree Logic (CTL). One can translate preference queries with respect to a set of preferences into an equivalent set of formulae in CTL, such that the CTL formula is satisfied whenever the preference query holds. This allows us to use a model checker to reason about preferences, i.e., answer preference queries, and to obtain a justification as to why a preference query is satisfied (or not) with respect to a set of preferences. This book defines the notions of the equivalence of two sets of preferences, including what it means for one set of preferences to subsume another, and shows how to answer preferential equivalence and subsumption queries using model checking. Furthermore, this book demontrates how to generate alternatives ordered by preference, along with providing ways to deal with inconsistent preference specifications. A description of CRISNER-an open source software implementation of the model checking approach to qualitative preference reasoning in CP-nets, TCP-nets, and CP-theories is included, as well as examples illustrating its use.",

    "description": "The use of logic in databases started in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s Codd formalized databases in terms of the relational calculus and the relational algebra. A major influence on the use of logic in databases was the development of the field of logic programming. Logic provides a convenient formalism for studying classical database problems and has the important property of being declarative, that is, it allows one to express what she wants rather than how to get it. For a long time, relational calculus and algebra were considered the relational database languages. However, there are simple operations, such as computing the transitive closure of a graph, which cannot be expressed with these languages. Datalog is a declarative query language for relational databases based on the logic programming paradigm. One of the peculiarities that distinguishes Datalog from query languages like relational algebra and calculus is recursion, which gives Datalog the capability to express queries like computing a graph transitive closure. Recent years have witnessed a revival of interest in Datalog in a variety of emerging application domains such as data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, cloud computing, ontology reasoning, and many others. The aim of this book is to present the basics of Datalog, some of its extensions, and recent applications to different domains.",

    "description": "Autonomous vehicles use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to provide a position within a few centimeters of truth. Centimeter positioning requires accurate measurement of each satellite s direct path propagation time. Multipath corrupts the propagation time estimate by creating a time-varying bias. A GNSS receiver model is developed and the effects of multipath are investigated. MATLABtm code is provided to enable readers to run simple GNSS receiver simulations. More specifically, GNSS signal models are presented and multipath mitigation techniques are described for various multipath conditions. Appendices are included in the booklet to derive some of the basics on early minus late code synchronization methods. Details on the numerically controlled oscillator and its properties are also given in the appendix.",

Despite the fact that these different scientific fields are trying to model the same physical entity (i.e. a crowd of people), research ideas have evolved independently. As a result each discipline has developed techniques and perspectives that are characteristically their own.\nThe goal of this book is to provide the readers a comprehensive map towards the common goal of better analyzing and synthesizing the pedestrian movement in dense, heterogeneous crowds. The book is organized into different parts that consolidate various aspects of research towards this common goal, namely the modeling, simulation, and visual analysis of crowds.\nThrough this book, readers will see the common ideas and vision as well as the different challenges and techniques, that will stimulate novel approaches to fully grasping \u201ccrowds.",

Each chapter focuses on one theoretical problem, proposes a novel solution, and is written in sufficiently non-technical language to be understandable by advanced undergraduates or scientists in allied fields. This book is the very first collection in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) focusing on theoretical, conceptual, and philosophical issues in the creation of thinking machines. All the authors are researchers actively developing AGI projects, thus distinguishing the book from much of the theoretical cognitive science and AI literature, which is generally quite divorced from practical AGI system building issues. And the discussions are presented in a way that makes the problems and proposed solutions understandable to a wide readership of non-specialists, providing a distinction from the journal and conference-proceedings literature. The book will benefit AGI researchers and students by giving them a solid orientation in the conceptual foundations of the field (which is not currently available anywhere); and it would benefit researchers in allied fields by giving them a high-level view of the current state of thinking in the AGI field. Furthermore, by addressing key topics in the field in a coherent way, the collection as a whole may play an important role in guiding future research in both theoretical and practical AGI, and in linking AGI research with work in allied disciplines",

    "description": "I am sure practitioners, auditors, and regulators will find the content of Mr Shaik s book of value. The accessible style is also welcome. All in all, a worthwhile addition to the finance literature and one that hopefully helps plug the knowledge gap in this field.\u2014 from the foreword by Professor Moorad Choudhry, Brunel University\nManaging Derivatives Contracts is a comprehensive and practical treatment of the end-to-end management of the derivatives contract operations, systems, and platforms that support the trading and business of derivative products. This book focuses on the processes and systems in the derivatives contract life cycle that underlie and implement the activities of derivatives trading, pricing, and risk management.\nKhader Shaik, a Wall Street derivatives platform implementation expert, lays out all the fundamentals needed to understand, conduct, and manage derivatives operations. In particular, he provides both introductory and in-depth treatment of the following topics: derivative product classes; the market structure, mechanics, and players of derivatives markets; types of derivative contracts and life cycle management; derivatives technology platforms, software systems, and protocols; derivatives contracts management; and the new regulatory landscape as shaped by reforms such as Dodd-Frank Title VII and EMIR. Managing Derivatives Contracts focuses on the operational processes and market environment of the derivatives life cycle; it does not address the mathematics or finance of derivatives trading, which are abundantly treated in the standard literature.\nManaging Derivatives Contracts is divided into four parts. The first part provides a structural overview of the derivatives markets and product classes. The second part examines the roles of derivatives market players, the organization of buy-side and sell-side firms, critical data elements, and the Dodd-Frank reforms. Within the framework of total market flow and straight-through processing as constrained by regulatory compliance, the core of the book details the contract life cycle from origination to expiration for each of the major derivatives product classes, including listed futures and options, cleared and bilateral OTC swaps, and credit derivatives. The final part of the book explores the underlying information technology platform, software systems, and protocols that drive the end-to-end business of derivatives. In particular, it supplies actionable guidelines on how to build a platform using vendor products, in-house development, or a hybrid approach.",

    "description": "This book presents a methodology to model and specify the data aspect of Web services, as it is overlooked by current standards for specifying Web services. The formal specification enables verification of service behavior, and the proposed methodology is based on formal methods and design-by-contract techniques.\nThe Web has evolved from an information sharing medium to a wide-scale environment for sharing capabilities or services. Currently, URLs not only point to documents and images, but are also used to invoke services that potentially change the state of the Web. Major online organizations today, such as Amazon, PayPal and FedEx, provide services for users and consumers. They also allow third-party vendors to resell their services. In both cases, this requires precise and complete specification of service offerings. Several online discussions demonstrate the challenges faced by these organizations and others while describing their data-centric Web services. These challenges surrounding data specification can lead consumers to use a service erroneously. Case studies demonstrate how formal methods, and specifically design-by-contract techniques, can be leveraged to address the lack of formal specification of data when it comes to developing Web applications such as Amazon and PayPal.",

Chapter 4 has been expanded with additional coverage of code review, bug tracker systems and agile software applications. The chapter order has been changed in response to feedback from readers and instructors who have taught classes using the previous version (which was also published by Apress).\nThis book provides an overview of tools and techniques used in enterprise software development, many of which are not taught in academic programs or learned on the job. This is an ideal resource containing lots of practical information and code examples that you need to master as a member of an enterprise development team.\nThis book aggregates many of theseon the jobtools and techniques into a concise format and presents them as both discussion topics and with code examples. The reader will not only get an overview of these tools and techniques, but also several discussions concerning operational aspects of enterprise software development and how it differs from smaller development efforts.\nFor example, in the chapter on Design Patterns and Architecture, the author describes the basics of design patterns but only highlights those that are more important in enterprise applications due to separation of duties, enterprise security, etc.\nThe architecture discussion revolves has a similar emphasis \u2013 different teams may manage different aspects of the application\u2019s components with little or no access to the developer.\nThis aspect of restricted access is also mentioned in the section on logging.\nTheory of logging and discussions of what to log are briefly mentioned, the configuration of the logging tools is demonstrated along with a discussion of why it\u2019s very important in an enterprise environment.",

It is not only part of a program, but it contains its own operating code: the image is a program in itself. Softimage aims to account for that new reality, taking readers on a journey that gradually undoes our unthinking reliance on the apparent solidity of the photographic image and building in its place an original and timely theorization of the digital image in all its complexity, one that promises to spark debate within the evolving fields of image studies and software studies.",

    "description": "The visual arts are rapidly changing as media moves into the web, mobile devices, and architecture. When designers and artists learn the basics of writing software, they develop a new form of literacy that enables them to create new media for the present, and to imagine future media that are beyond the capacities of current software tools. This book introduces this new literacy by teaching computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity. Written by Processing s cofounders, the book offers a definitive reference for students and professionals. Tutorial chapters make up the bulk of the book; advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and installation are discussed in interviews with their creators.\nThis second edition has been thoroughly updated. It is the first book to offer in-depth coverage of Processing 2.0 and 3.0, and all examples have been updated for the new syntax. Every chapter has been revised, and new chapters introduce new ways to work with data and geometry. Newsynthesischapters offer discussion and worked examples of such topics as sketching with code, modularity, and algorithms. New interviews have been added that cover a wider range of projects.Extensionchapters are now offered online so they can be updated to keep pace with technological developments in such fields as computer vision and electronics.",

In many practice-based art texts and classrooms, technology is divorced from the socio-political concerns of those using it. Although there are many resources for media theorists, practice-based students sometimes find it difficult to engage with a text that fails to relate theoretical concerns to the act of creating. Net Works strives to fill that gap.\nUsing websites as case studies, each chapter introduces a different style of web project from formalist play to social activism to data visualization and then includes the artistsor entrepreneursreflections on the particular challenges and outcomes of developing that web project. Scholarly introductions to each section apply a theoretical frame for the projects. A companion website offers further resources for hands-on learning.\nCombining practical skills for web authoring with critical perspectives on the web, Net Works is ideal for courses in new media design, art, communication, critical studies, media and technology, or popular digital/internet culture.",

    "description": "The book focuses on different variants of decision tree induction but also describesthe meta-learning approach in general which is applicable to other types of machine learning algorithms. The book discusses different variants of decision tree induction and represents a useful source of information to readers wishing to review some of the techniques used in decision tree learning, as well as different ensemble methods that involve decision trees. It is shown that the knowledge of different components used within decision tree learning needs to be systematized to enable the system to generate and evaluate different variants of machine learning algorithms with the aim of identifying the top-most performers or potentially the best one. A unified view of decision tree learning enables to emulate different decision tree algorithms simply by setting certain parameters. As meta-learning requires running many different processes with the aim of obtaining performance results, a detailed description of the experimental methodology and evaluation framework is provided. Meta-learning is discussed in great detail in the second half of the book. The exposition starts by presenting a comprehensive review of many meta-learning approaches explored in the past described in literature, including for instance approaches that provide a ranking of algorithms. The approach described can be related to other work that exploits planning whose aim is to construct data mining workflows. The book stimulates interchange of ideas between different, albeit related, approaches.",

Efficient Learning Machines explores the major topics of machine learning, including knowledge discovery, classifications, genetic algorithms, neural networking, kernel methods, and biologically-inspired techniques.\nMariette Awad and Rahul Khanna\u2019s synthetic approach weaves together the theoretical exposition, design principles, and practical applications of efficient machine learning. Their experiential emphasis, expressed in their close analysis of sample algorithms throughout the book, aims to equip engineers, students of engineering, and system designers to design and create new and more efficient machine learning systems. Readers of Efficient Learning Machines will learn how to recognize and analyze the problems that machine learning technology can solve for them, how to implement and deploy standard solutions to sample problems, and how to design new systems and solutions.\nAdvances in computing performance, storage, memory, unstructured information retrieval, and cloud computing have coevolved with a new generation of machine learning paradigms and big data analytics, which the authors present in the conceptual context of their traditional precursors. Awad and Khanna explore current developments in the deep learning techniques of deep neural networks, hierarchical temporal memory, and cortical algorithms.\nNature suggests sophisticated learning techniques that deploy simple rules to generate highly intelligent and organized behaviors with adaptive, evolutionary, and distributed properties. The authors examine the most popular biologically-inspired algorithms, together with a sample application to distributed datacenter management. They also discuss machine learning techniques for addressing problems of multi-objective optimization in which solutions in real-world systems are constrained and evaluated based on how well they perform with respect to multiple objectives in aggregate. Two chapters on support vector machines and their extensions focus on recent improvements to the classification and regression techniques at the core of machine learning.",

This book is divided into five broad parts. Part I introduces software testing in the broader context of software engineering and explores the qualities that testing aims to achieve or ascertain, as well as the lifecycle of software testing. Part II covers mathematical foundations of software testing, which include software specification, program correctness and verification, concepts of software dependability, and a software testing taxonomy. Part III discusses test data generation, specifically, functional criteria and structural criteria. Test oracle design, test driver design, and test outcome analysis is covered in Part IV. Finally, Part V surveys managerial aspects of software testing, including software metrics, software testing tools, and software product line testing. * Presents software testing, not as an isolated technique, but as part of an integrated discipline of software verification and validation * Proposes program testing and program correctness verification within the same mathematical model, making it possible to deploy the two techniques in concert, by virtue of the law of diminishing returns * Defines the concept of a software fault, and the related concept of relative correctness, and shows how relative correctness can be used to characterize monotonic fault removal * Presents the activity of software testing as a goal oriented activity, and explores how the conduct of the test depends on the selected goal * Covers all phases of the software testing lifecycle, including test data generation, test oracle design, test driver design, and test outcome analysis Software Testing: Concepts and Operations is a great resource for software quality and software engineering students because it presents them with fundamentals that help them to prepare for their ever evolving discipline.",

It considers two directions for image encryption: permutation-based approaches and substitution-based approaches.\nCovering the spectrum of image encryption principles and techniques, the book compares image encryption with permutation- and diffusion-based approaches. It explores number theory-based encryption algorithms such as the Data Encryption Standard, the Advanced Encryption Standard, and the RC6 algorithms. It not only details the strength of various encryption algorithms, but also describes their ability to work within the limitations of wireless communication systems.\nSince some ciphers were not designed for image encryption, the book explains how to modify these ciphers to work for image encryption. It also provides instruction on how to search for other approaches suitable for this task. To make this work comprehensive, the authors explore communication concepts concentrating on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system and present a simplified model for the OFDM communication system with its different implementations.\nComplete with simulation experiments and MATLAB\u00ae codes for most of the simulation experiments, this book will help you gain the understanding required to select the encryption method that best fulfills your application requirements.",

    "description": "Probability as an Alternative to Boolean Logic<br />\nWhile logic is the mathematical foundation of rational reasoning and the fundamental principle of computing, it is restricted to problems where information is both complete and certain. However, many real-world problems, from financial investments to email filtering, are incomplete or uncertain in nature. Probability theory and Bayesian computing together provide an alternative framework to deal with incomplete and uncertain data.\nDecision-Making Tools and Methods for Incomplete and Uncertain Data<br />\nEmphasizing probability as an alternative to Boolean logic, Bayesian Programming covers new methods to build probabilistic programs for real-world applications. Written by the team who designed and implemented an efficient probabilistic inference engine to interpret Bayesian programs, the book offers many Python examples that are also available on a supplementary website together with an interpreter that allows readers to experiment with this new approach to programming.\nPrinciples and Modeling<br />\nOnly requiring a basic foundation in mathematics, the first two parts of the book present a new methodology for building subjective probabilistic models. The authors introduce the principles of Bayesian programming and discuss good practices for probabilistic modeling. Numerous simple examples highlight the application of Bayesian modeling in different fields.\nFormalism and Algorithms<br />\nThe third part synthesizes existing work on Bayesian inference algorithms since an efficient Bayesian inference engine is needed to automate the probabilistic calculus in Bayesian programs. Many bibliographic references are included for readers who would like more details on the formalism of Bayesian programming, the main probabilistic models, general purpose algorithms for Bayesian inference, and learning problems.\nFAQs<br />\nAlong with a glossary, the fourth part contains answers to frequently asked questions. The authors compare Bayesian programming and possibility theories, discuss the computational complexity of Bayesian inference, cover the irreducibility of incompleteness, and address the subjectivist versus objectivist epistemology of probability.\nThe First Steps toward a Bayesian Computer<br />\nA new modeling methodology, new inference algorithms, new programming languages, and new hardware are all needed to create a complete Bayesian computing framework. Focusing on the methodology and algorithms, this book describes the first steps toward reaching that goal. It encourages readers to explore emerging areas, such as bio-inspired computing, and develop new programming languages and hardware architectures.",

    "description": "This book is primarily intended as a research monograph that could also be used in graduate courses for the design of parallel algorithms in matrix computations.\nIt assumes general but not extensive knowledge of numerical linear algebra, parallel architectures, and parallel programming paradigms.\nThe book consists of four parts: (I) Basics; (II) Dense and Special Matrix Computations; (III) Sparse Matrix Computations; and (IV) Matrix functions and characteristics. Part I deals with parallel programming paradigms and fundamental kernels, including reordering schemes for sparse matrices. Part II is devoted to dense matrix computations such as parallel algorithms for solving linear systems, linear least squares, the symmetric algebraic eigenvalue problem, and the singular-value decomposition. It also deals with the development of parallel algorithms for special linear systems such as banded ,Vandermonde ,Toeplitz ,and block Toeplitz systems. Part III addresses sparse matrix computations: (a) the development of parallel iterative linear system solvers with emphasis on scalable preconditioners, (b) parallel schemes for obtaining a few of the extreme eigenpairs or those contained in a given interval in the spectrum of a standard or generalized symmetric eigenvalue problem, and (c) parallel methods for computing a few of the extreme singular triplets. Part IV focuses on the development of parallel algorithms for matrix functions and special characteristics such as the matrix pseudospectrum and the determinant. The book also reviews the theoretical and practical background necessary when designing these algorithms and includes an extensive bibliography that will be useful to researchers and students alike.\nThe book brings together many existing algorithms for the fundamental matrix computations that have a proven track record of efficient implementation in terms of data locality and data transfer on state-of-the-art systems, as well as several algorithms that are presented for the first time, focusing on the opportunities for parallelism and algorithm robustness.",

    "description": "Digital games offer enormous potential for learning and engagement in mathematics ideas and processes. This volume offers multidisciplinary perspectives\u2015of educators, cognitive scientists, psychologists and sociologists\u2015on how digital games influence the social activities and mathematical ideas of learners/gamers. Contributing authors identify opportunities for broadening current understandings of how mathematical ideas are fostered (and embedded) within digital game environments. In particular, the volume advocates for new and different ways of thinking about mathematics in our digital age\u2015proposing that these mathematical ideas and numeracy practices are distinct from new literacies or multiliteracies. The authors acknowledge that the promise of digital games has not always been realised/fulfilled. There is emerging, and considerable, evidence to suggest that traditional discipline boundaries restrict opportunities for mathematical learning. Throughout the book, what constitutes mathematics learnings and pedagogy is contested. Multidisciplinary viewpoints are used to describe and understand the potential of digital games for learning mathematics and identify current tensions within the field.\nMathematics learning is defined as being about problem solving; engagement in mathematical ideas and processes; and social engagement. The artefact, which is the game, shapes the ways in which the gamers engage with the social activity of gaming. In parallel, the book (as a te\nxtual artefact) will be supported by Springer\u2019s online platform\u2015allowing for video and digital communication (including links to relevant websites) to be used as supplementary material and establish a dynamic communication space.",

    "description": "Through this book, researchers and students will learn to use R for analysis of large-scale genomic data and how to create routines to automate analytical steps. The philosophy behind the book is to start with real world raw datasets and perform all the analytical steps needed to reach final results. Though theory plays an important role, this is a practical book for graduate and undergraduate courses in bioinformatics and genomic analysis or for use in lab sessions. How to handle and manage high-throughput genomic data, create automated workflows and speed up analyses in R is also taught. A wide range of R packages useful for working with genomic data are illustrated with practical examples.\nThe key topics covered are association studies, genomic prediction, estimation of population genetic parameters and diversity, gene expression analysis, functional annotation of results using publically available databases and how to work efficiently in R with large genomic datasets. Important principles are demonstrated and illustrated through engaging examples which invite the reader to work with the provided datasets. Some methods that are discussed in this volume include: signatures of selection, population parameters (LD, FST, FIS, etc); use of a genomic relationship matrix for population diversity studies; use of SNP data for parentage testing; snpBLUP and gBLUP for genomic prediction. Step-by-step, all the R code required for a genome-wide association study is shown: starting from raw SNP data, how to build databases to handle and manage the data, quality control and filtering measures, association testing and evaluation of results, through to identification and functional annotation of candidate genes. Similarly, gene expression analyses are shown using microarray and RNAseq data.\nAt a time when genomic data is decidedly big, the skills from this book are critical. In recent years R has become the de facto&lt; tool for analysis of gene expression data, in addition to its prominent role in analysis of genomic data. Benefits to using R include the integrated development environment for analysis, flexibility and control of the analytic workflow. Included topics are core components of advanced undergraduate and graduate classes in bioinformatics, genomics and statistical genetics. This book is also designed to be used by students in computer science and statistics who want to learn the practical aspects of genomic analysis without delving into algorithmic details. The datasets used throughout the book may be downloaded from the publisher\u2019s website.",

    "description": "Today enterprises generate huge volumes of data. In order to provide effective services and to make smarter and more intelligent decisions from these huge volumes of data, enterprises use big-data analytics. In recent years, Hadoop has been used for massive data storage and efficient distributed processing of data. The Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) framework solves the design problems related to resource management faced by the Hadoop 1.x framework by providing a more scalable, efficient, flexible, and highly available resource management framework for distributed data processing.\nThis book starts with an overview of the YARN features and explains how YARN provides a business solution for growing big data needs. You will learn to provision and manage single, as well as multi-node, Hadoop-YARN clusters in the easiest way. You will walk through the YARN administration, life cycle management, application execution, REST APIs, schedulers, security framework and so on. You will gain insights about the YARN components and features such as ResourceManager, NodeManager, ApplicationMaster, Container, Timeline Server, High Availability, Resource Localisation and so on.\nThe book explains Hadoop-YARN commands and the configurations of components and explores topics such as High Availability, Resource Localization and Log aggregation. You will then be ready to develop your own ApplicationMaster and execute it over a Hadoop-YARN cluster.\nTowards the end of the book, you will learn about the security architecture and integration of YARN with big data technologies like Spark and Storm. This book promises conceptual as well as practical knowledge of resource management using YARN.",

    "description": "Computational intelligence is a well-established paradigm, where new theories with a sound biological understanding have been evolving. The current experimental systems have many of the characteristics of biological computers (brains in other words) and are beginning to be built to perform a variety of tasks that are difficult or impossible to do with conventional computers. As evident, the ultimate achievement in this field would be to mimic or exceed human cognitive capabilities including reasoning, recognition, creativity, emotions, understanding, learning and so on. This book comprising of 17 chapters offers a step-by-step introduction (in a chronological order) to the various modern computational intelligence tools used in practical problem solving. Staring with different search techniques including informed and uninformed search, heuristic search, minmax, alpha-beta pruning methods, evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligent techniques; the authors illustrate the design of knowledge-based systems and advanced expert systems, which incorporate uncertainty and fuzziness. Machine learning algorithms including decision trees and artificial neural networks are presented and finally the fundamentals of hybrid intelligent systems are also depicted.\nAcademics, scientists as well as engineers engaged in research, development and application of computational intelligence techniques, machine learning and data mining would find the comprehensive coverage of this book invaluable.",

Here we study with rates the approximation properties of therightsigmoidal and hyperbolic tangent artificial neural network positive linear operators. In particular we study the degree of approximation of these operators to the unit operator in the univariate and multivariate cases over bounded or unbounded domains. This is given via inequalities and with the use of modulus of continuity of the involved function or its higher order derivative. We examine the real and complex cases.<br />\nFor the convenience of the reader, the chapters of this book are written in a self-contained style.<br />\nThis treatise relies on author s last two years of related research work.<br />\nAdvanced courses and seminars can be taught out of this brief book. All necessary background and motivations are given per chapter. A related list of references is given also per chapter. The exposed results are expected to find applications in many areas of computer science and applied mathematics, such as neural networks, intelligent systems, complexity theory, learning theory, vision and approximation theory, etc. As such this monograph is suitable for researchers, graduate students, and seminars of the above subjects, also for all science libraries.",

    "description": "Civil engineering structures such as buildings, bridges, stadiums, and offshore structures play an import role in our daily life. However, constructing these structures requires lots of budget. Thus, how to cost-efficiently design structures satisfying all required design constraints is an important factor to structural engineers. Traditionally, mathematical gradient-based optimal techniques have been applied to the design of optimal structures. While, many practical engineering optimal problems are very complex and hard to solve by traditional method. In the past few decades, swarm intelligence algorithms, which were inspired by the social behaviour of natural animals such as fish schooling and bird flocking, were developedbecause they do not require conventional mathematical assumptions and thus possess better global search abilities than the traditional optimization algorithms andhave attracted more and more attention. These intelligent based algorithms are very suitable for continuous and discrete design variable problems such as ready-made structural members and have been vigorously applied to various structural design problems and obtained good results. This book gathers the authors\u2019 latest research work related with particle swarm optimizer algorithm and group search optimizer algorithm as well as their application to structural optimal design. The readers can understand the full spectrum of the algorithms and apply the algorithms to their own research problems.",

    "description": "One of the most distinguishing abilities that human beings display is the ability of turning almost everything into a clue to make a problem affordable in relation to what one knows and, most of all, to what one does not know. That is what characterizes humans as chance seekers. A poor pattern of reasoning and even our ignorance may help us make a decision, and eventually solve a problem. This is the rationale of biased rationality. However, not everything leads us always to a good decision. Some people are not satisfied with weak arguments or it-is-just-so strategies. They want something better. This second attitude points to a different form of rationality that takes advantage of the idea of distributed cognition. Basically, human beings improve their survival strategies by building cognitive niches capable of delivering potentially ever more symptomatic information. It is through various manipulations of the environment that we gain new and more reliable chances which can be used to de-bias our rationality. Through the laborious activity of cognitive niche construction, we come up with situations in which we are better afforded by our environment, and thus biases or fallacies cease to be appealing.",

PLASTIC is instantiated in both a model-based approach, PLASTIC-Model and a policy-based approach, PLASTIC-Policy. In addition to reusing knowledge learned from previous teammates, PLASTIC also allows users to provide expert-knowledge and can use transfer learning (such as the new Two Stage Transfer algorithm) to quickly create models of new teammates when it has some information about its new teammates. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on three domains, ranging from multi-armed bandits to simulated robot soccer games.",

In our real environment, however, objects do not appear so neatly. Our visual world is a stimulating scenery mess; fragments, colors, occlusions, motions, eye movements, context, and distraction all affect perception. In this volume, pioneering researchers address the visual cognition of scenes from neuroimaging, psychology, modeling, electrophysiology, and computer vision perspectives.\nBuilding on past researchand accepting the challenge of applying what we have learned from the study of object recognition to the visual cognition of scenesthese leading scholars consider issues of spatial vision, context, rapid perception, emotion, attention, memory, and the neural mechanisms underlying scene representation. Taken together, their contributions offer a snapshot of our current knowledge of how we understand scenes and the visual world around us.",

    "description": "This new edition covers the central concepts of practical optimization techniques, with an emphasis on methods that are both state-of-the-art and popular. One major insight is the connection between the purely analytical character of an optimization problem and the behavior of algorithms used to solve a problem. This was a major theme of the first edition of this book and the fourth edition expands and further illustrates this relationship. As in the earlier editions, the material in this fourth edition is organized into three separate parts. Part I is a self-contained introduction to linear programming. The presentation in this part is fairly conventional, covering the main elements of the underlying theory of linear programming, many of the most effective numerical algorithms, and many of its important special applications. Part II, which is independent of Part I, covers the theory of unconstrained optimization, including both derivations of the appropriate optimality conditions and an introduction to basic algorithms. This part of the book explores the general properties of algorithms and defines various notions of convergence. Part III extends the concepts developed in the second part to constrained optimization problems. Except for a few isolated sections, this part is also independent of Part I. It is possible to go directly into Parts II and III omitting Part I, and, in fact, the book has been used in this way in many universities.\nNew to this edition is a chapter devoted to Conic Linear Programming, a powerful generalization of Linear Programming. Indeed, many conic structures are possible and useful in a variety of applications. It must be recognized, however, that conic linear programming is an advanced topic, requiring special study. Another important topic is an accelerated steepest descent method that exhibits superior convergence properties, and for this reason, has become quite popular. The proof of the convergence property for both standard and accelerated steepest descent methods are presented in Chapter 8. As in previous editions, end-of-chapter exercises appear for all chapters.",

H. S. Lahman shows how to address all these challenges by integrating proven object-oriented techniques with a powerful new methodology.\nModel-Based Development represents Lahman\u2019s half century of experience as a pioneering software innovator. Building on Shlaer-Mellor\u2019s work, Lahman\u2019s unique approach fully delivers on the promise of models and is firmly grounded in the realities of contemporary development, design, and architecture.<br />\nThe book introduces the methodology\u2019s core principles, showing how it separates each of a project\u2019s concerns, enabling practitioners to optimize each domain for its unique needs and characteristics. Next, it demonstrates how to perform more effective object-oriented analysis, emphasizing abstraction, disciplined partitioning, modeling invariants, finite state machines, and efficient communications among program units.\nCoverage includes<br />\nHow we got here: a historical perspective and pragmatic review of object principles<br />\nProblem space versus computing space: reflecting crucial distinctions between customer and computer environments in your designs<br />\nApplication partitioning: why it matters and how do it well<br />\nBuilding static models that describe basic application structure<br />\nModeling classes, class responsibilities, associations, and both referential and knowledge integrity<br />\nCreating dynamic models that describe behavior via finite state machines<br />\nSuccessfully using abstract action languages (AALs) and action data flow diagrams (ADFDs)\nThroughout, Lahman illuminates theoretical issues in practical terms, explaining why things are done as they are, without demanding rigorous math. His focus is on creating implementation-independent models that resolve functional requirements completely, precisely, and unambiguously. Whether you\u2019re a developer, team leader, architect, or designer, Lahman\u2019s techniques will help you build software that\u2019s more robust, easier to maintain, supports larger-scale reuse, and whose specification is rigorous enough to enable full-scale automatic code generation.",

    "description": "Metadata research has emerged as a discipline cross-cutting many domains, focused on the provision of distributed descriptions (often called annotations) to Web resources or applications. Such associated descriptions are supposed to serve as a foundation for advanced services in many application areas, including search and location, personalization, federation of repositories and automated delivery of information. Indeed, the Semantic Web is in itself a concrete technological framework for ontology-based metadata. For example, Web-based social networking requires metadata describing people and their interrelations, and large databases with biological information use complex and detailed metadata schemas for more precise and informed search strategies.<br />\nThere is a wide diversity in the languages and idioms used for providing meta-descriptions, from simple structured text in metadata schemas to formal annotations using ontologies, and the technologies for storing, sharing and exploiting meta-descriptions are also diverse and evolve rapidly. In addition, there is a proliferation of schemas and standards related to metadata, resulting in a complex and moving technological landscape \u2014 hence, the need for specialized knowledge and skills in this area.\nTheHandbook of Metadata, Semantics and Ontologies is intended as an authoritative reference for students, practitioners and researchers, serving as a roadmap for the variety of metadata schemas and ontologies available in a number of key domain areas, including culture, biology, education, healthcare, engineering and library science.\nReadership: Graduates and senior undergraduates in computing or information science; researchers in metadata, semantics and ontologies; practitioners in planning or managing information systems.",

    "description": "This book first introduces classic as well as recent computational models for just-noticeable-difference (JND) applications. Since the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is applied in many image and video standards (JPEG, MPEG-1/2/4, H.261/3), the book also includes a comprehensive survey of computational models for JND that are based on DCT. The visual factors used in these computational models are reviewed in detail. Further, an extensive comparative analysis of these models using quantitative and qualitative performance criteria is presented, which compares the noise shaping performance of these models with subjective evaluation and the accuracy between the estimated JND thresholds and subjective evaluation.\nThere are many surveys available on computational models for JND; however, these surveys seldom compare the performance of computational models that are based on DCT. The authors\u2019 survey of the computational models and their in-depth review of the visual factors used in them will help readers understand perceptual image coding based on DCT. The book also provides a comparative analysis of several perceptual image coders that are based on DCT, which are compatible with the highly popular and widely adopted JPEG standard.",

Recommender systems built on the assumption of availability of both positive and negative examples do not perform well when negative examples are rare. It is exactly this problem that the authors address in the monograph at hand. Specifically, the books approach is based on one-class classification methodologies that have been appearing in recent machine learning research. The blending of recommender systems and one-class classification provides a new very fertile field for research, innovation and development with potential applications in \u201cbig data\u201d as well as \u201csparse data\u201d problems.\nThe book will be useful to researchers, practitioners and graduate students dealing with problems of extensive and complex data. It is intended for both the expert/researcher in the fields of Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning and Recommender Systems, as well as for the general reader in the fields of Applied and Computer Science who wishes to learn more about the emerging discipline of Recommender Systems and their applications.

    "description": "The World Wide Web constitutes the largest existing source of texts written in a great variety of languages. A feasible and sound way of exploiting this data for linguistic research is to compile a static corpus for a given language. There are several adavantages of this approach: (i) Working with such corpora obviates the problems encountered when using Internet search engines in quantitative linguistic research (such as non-transparent ranking algorithms). (ii) Creating a corpus from web data is virtually free. (iii) The size of corpora compiled from the WWW may exceed by several orders of magnitudes the size of language resources offered elsewhere. (iv) The data is locally available to the user, and it can be linguistically post-processed and queried with the tools preferred by her/him. This book addresses the main practical tasks in the creation of web corpora up to giga-token size. Among these tasks are the sampling process (i.e., web crawling) and the usual cleanups including boilerplate removal and removal of duplicated content. Linguistic processing and problems with linguistic processing coming from the different kinds of noise in web corpora are also covered. Finally, the authors show how web corpora can be evaluated and compared to other corpora (such as traditionally compiled corpora).\nFor additional material please visit the companion website: sites.morganclaypool.com/wcc\nTable of Contents: Preface / Acknowledgments / Web Corpora / Data Collection / Post-Processing / Linguistic Processing / Corpus Evaluation and Comparison / Bibliography / AuthorsBiographies",

    "description": "Large surface computing devices (wall-mounted or tabletop) with touch interfaces and their application to collaborative data analysis, an increasingly important and prevalent activity, is the primary topic of this book. Our goals are to outline the fundamentals of surface computing (a still maturing technology), review relevant work on collaborative data analysis, describe frameworks for understanding collaborative processes, and provide a better understanding of the opportunities for research and development. We describe surfaces as display technologies with which people can interact directly, and emphasize how interaction design changes when designing for large surfaces. We review efforts to use large displays, surfaces or mixed display environments to enable collaborative analytic activity. Collaborative analysis is important in many domains, but to provide concrete examples and a specific focus, we frequently consider analysis work in the security domain, and in particular the challenges security personnel face in securing networks from attackers, and intelligence analysts encounter when analyzing intelligence data. Both of these activities are becoming increasingly collaborative endeavors, and there are huge opportunities for improving collaboration by leveraging surface computing. This work highlights for interaction designers and software developers the particular challenges and opportunities presented by interaction with surfaces. We have reviewed hundreds of recent research papers, and report on advancements in the fields of surface-enabled collaborative analytic work, interactive techniques for surface technologies, and useful theory that can provide direction to interaction design work. We also offer insight into issues that arise when developing applications for multi-touch surfaces derived from our own experiences creating collaborative applications. We present these insights at a level appropriate for all members of the software design and development team.\nTable of Contents: List of Figures / Acknowledgments / Figure Credits / Purpose and Direction / Surface Technologies and Collaborative Analysis Systems / Interacting with Surface Technologies / Collaborative Work Enabled by Surfaces / The Theory and the Design of Surface Applications / The Development of Surface Applications / Concluding Comments / Bibliography / AuthorsBiographies",

We then review the kinds of technology options that are available today, focusing more on types of technologies rather than specific instances. We describe a database of geographically distributed projects we have studied and introduce the Collaboration Success Wizard, an online tool for assessing past, present, or planned distributed collaborations. We close with a set of recommendations for individuals, managers, and those higher in the organizations who wish to support distance work.",

    "description": "As we use the Web for social networking, shopping, and news, we leave a personal trail. These days, linger over a Web page selling lamps, and they will turn up at the advertising margins as you move around the Internet, reminding you, tempting you to make that purchase. Search engines such as Google can now look deep into the data on the Web to pull out instances of the words you are looking for. And there are pages that collect and assess information to give you a snapshot of changing political opinion. These are just basic examples of the growth ofWeb intelligence , as increasingly sophisticated algorithms operate on the vast and growing amount of data on the Web, sifting, selecting, comparing, aggregating, correcting; following simple but powerful rules to decide what matters. While original optimism for Artificial Intelligence declined, this new kind of machine intelligence is emerging as the Web grows ever larger and more interconnected.\nGautam Shroff takes us on a journey through the computer science of search, natural language, text mining, machine learning, swarm computing, and semantic reasoning, from Watson to self-driving cars. This machine intelligence may even mimic at a basic level what happens in the brain.",

    "description": "This textbook explores the different aspects of data mining from the fundamentals to the complex data types and their applications, capturing the wide diversity of problem domains for data mining issues. It goes beyond the traditional focus on data mining problems to introduce advanced data types such as text, time series, discrete sequences, spatial data, graph data, and social networks. Until now, no single book has addressed all these topics in a comprehensive and integrated way. The chapters of this book fall into one of three categories:Fundamental chapters: Data mining has four main problems, which correspond to clustering, classification, association pattern mining, and outlier analysis. These chapters comprehensively discuss a wide variety of methods for these problems.\nDomain chapters: These chapters discuss the specific methods used for different domains of data such as text data, time-series data, sequence data, graph data, and spatial data.\nApplication chapters: These chapters study important applications such as stream mining, Web mining, ranking, recommendations, social networks, and privacy preservation. The domain chapters also have an applied flavor.Appropriate for both introductory and advanced data mining courses, Data Mining: The Textbook balances mathematical details and intuition. It contains the necessary mathematical details for professors and researchers, but it is presented in a simple and intuitive style to improve accessibility for students and industrial practitioners (including those with a limited mathematical background). Numerous illustrations, examples, and exercises are included, with an emphasis on semantically interpretable examples.",
