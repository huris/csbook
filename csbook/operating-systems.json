    "description": "The Debian GNU/Linux operating system approaches Linux system administration differently than other popular Linux distributions, favoring text-based configuration mechanisms over graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Debian may appear simplistic and even slightly outdated, but it is actually very robust, scalable, and secure. Debian s open development cycle and strict quality control by the developers help Debian to constantly gain popularity, despite its reputation as an operating system just for professionals and hardcore computer hobbyists.\nThe Debian System\u00a0introduces the concepts and techniques of the Debian operating system, explaining their usage and pitfalls, and illustrating the thinking behind each of the approaches. The book s goal is to give the reader enough insight into the workings of the Debian project and operating system so that they will understand the solutions that have evolved as part of the Debian system over the past decade. While targeted at the well-versed UNIX/Linux administrator, the book can also serve as an excellent resource alongside a standard Linux reference to quickly orient the reader to Debian s unique philosophy and structure. Co-published with Open Source Press, an independent publisher based in Munich that specializes in the field of free and open source software.",

The Tcl/Tk combination is increasingly popular because it lets you produce sophisticated graphical interfaces with a few easy commands, develop and change scripts quickly, and conveniently tie together existing utilities or programming libraries.One of the attractive features of Tcl/Tk is the wide variety of commands, many offering a wealth of options. Most of the things you d like to do have been anticipated by the language s creator, John Ousterhout, or one of the developers of Tcl/Tk s many powerful extensions. Thus, you ll find that a command or option probably exists to provide just what you need.And that s why it s valuable to have a quick reference that briefly describes every command and option in the core Tcl/Tk distribution as well as the most popular extensions. Keep this book on your desk as you write scripts, and you ll be able to find almost instantly the particular option you need.Most chapters consist of alphabetical listings. Since Tk and mega-widget packages break down commands by widget, the chapters on these topics are organized by widget along with a section of core commands where appropriate. Contents include:Core Tcl and Tk commands and Tk widgets\nC interface (prototypes)\nExpect\n[incr Tcl] and [incr Tk]\nTix\nTclX\nBLT\nOratcl, SybTcl, and Tclodbc",

It describes the iteration principle by which the DNS translates names to IP addresses. It presents a configuration of a resolver both for UNIX and for Windows. The end of the chapter explains name server principles and describes various name server types.<br />\nChapter 2 is fully focused on the most basic DNS procedure, the DNS query. Through this procedure, the DNS translates names to IP addresses. In the very beginning, however, this chapter describes in detail the Resource Record structure. At the end of this chapter, many practical examples of DNS exchanges are listed.<br />\nChapter 3 deals with other DNS procedures (DNS Extensions), i.e., DNS Update, DNS Notify, incremental zone transfer, negative caching, IPv6 Extensions, IPsec, and TSIG.<br />\nChapter 4 talks about the DNS implementation. It is derived from its historical evolution. From the historical point of view, the oldest DNS implementation that is still sometimes used is BIND version 4. This implementation is very simple so it is suitable to describe basic principles with it. Next, the new generations of BIND are discussed followed by the Windows 2000 implementation.<br />\nChapter 5 discusses the tools for debugging DNS such as nslookup, dnswalk, and dig, how to control a name server using the rndc program, and the common errors that might occur while configuring DNS.<br />\nChapter 6 deals with the creation of DNS domains (domain delegation) and with the procedure of domain registration.",

These are all part of administration tasks, hence network administration is one of the main tasks of Linux system administration. By knowing how to configure system network interfaces in a reliable and optimal manner, Linux administrators can deploy and configure several network services including file, web, mail, and servers while working in large enterprise environments.\nStarting with a simple Linux router that passes traffic between two private networks, you will see how to enable NAT on the router in order to allow Internet access from the network, and will also enable DHCP on the network to ease configuration of client systems. You will then move on to configuring your own DNS server on your local network using bind9 and tying it into your DHCP server to allow automatic configuration of local hostnames. You will then future enable your network by setting up IPv6 via tunnel providers.\nMoving on, we ll configure Samba to centralize authentication for your network services; we will also configure Linux client to leverage it for authentication, and set up a RADIUS server that uses the directory server for authentication.\nToward the end, you will have a network with a number of services running on it, and will implement monitoring in order to detect problems as they occur.\nWhat you will learnRoute an IPv6 netblock to your local network\nModify your named instance to support setting hostnames for your IPv6 addresses\nUse SSH for remote console access\nConfigure NGINX with TLS\nSecure XMPP with TLS\nLeverage iptables6 to firewall your IPv6 traffic\nConfigure Samba as an Active Directory compatible directory service",

Its applications are as broad and varied as mobile smartphone applications themselves. This book will educate you on the best practices and methodology needed to build effective, stable, and performant mobile VR applications.\nIn this book, we begin by defining virtual reality (VR) and how Google Cardboard fits into the larger VR and Android ecosystem. We introduce the underlying scientific and technical principles behind VR, including geometry, optics, rendering, and mobile software architecture. We start with a simple example app that ensures your environment is properly set up to write, build, and run the app. Then we develop a reusable VR graphics engine that you can build upon. And from then on, each chapter is a self-contained project where you will build an example from a different genre of application, including a 360 degree photo viewer, an educational simulation of our solar system, a 3D model viewer, and a music visualizer.\nGiven the recent updates that were rolled out at Google I/O 2016, the authors of Cardboard VR Projects for Android have collated some technical notes to help you execute the projects in this book with Google VR Cardboard Java SDK 0.8, released in May 2016. Refer to the article at https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/GoogleVRUpdateGuideforCardbook.pdf which explains the updates to the source code of the projects.\nWho This Book Is For\nThe book is for established Android developers with a good knowledge level of Java. No prior OpenGL or graphics knowledge is required. No prior experience with Google Cardboard is expected, but those who are familiar with Cardboard and are looking for projects to expand their knowledge can also benefit from this book.\nWhat You Will LearnBuild Google Cardboard virtual reality applications\nExplore the ins and outs of the Cardboard SDK Java classes and interfaces, and apply them to practical VR projects\nEmploy Android Studio, Android SDK, and the Java language in a straightforward manner\nDiscover and use software development and Android best practices for mobile and Cardboard applications, including considerations for memory management and battery life\nImplement user interface techniques for menus and gaze-based selection within VR\nUtilize the science, psychology, mathematics, and technology behind virtual reality, especially those pertinent to mobile Cardboard VR experiences\nUnderstand Cardboard VR best practices including those promoted by Google Design Lab.",

The Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) standard provides both an application programming interface and a search language (based on SQL-92). Alfresco CMIS implementation is the basis for many existing CMIS applications, and you can use CMIS too to integrate your application with Alfresco.\nAlfresco CMIS is a practical, hands-on guide that provides you with a number of clear step-by-step exercises that will help you take advantage of the real power of CMIS, and give you a good foundation in using it via HTTP/XML, Java, or scripting.It starts off with an introduction to the CMIS standard, in order to update you on the service API, object model, and query language.\nThe first part of the book explains how to use the service API with HTTP and XML/JSON; this is done in order to show that any library, system, or tool that can make HTTP calls and parse XML or JSON, is able to talk to a content management server that supports CMIS. Next, you learn to demonstrate how a higher abstraction library can be used to talk to a CMIS server in an easy way, hiding some of the complexities of the API using the OpenCMIS Java library. Since most of the applications that are built today are web applications, the book teaches readers how CMIS can be used from JavaScript and Groovy; enterprise application integration, taking Drupal and Mule as references.\nFinally, you will learn how to talk to Alfresco Cloud service via CMIS!\nWho This Book Is For\nIf you are a developer who wants to learn how to build applications that talk to content management servers in a standard way using CMIS, this book is ideal for you. It will be helpful if you have a bit of programming experience, although it is not necessary.\nWhat You Will LearnAdd, update, delete, and search for content with increasing efficiency using HTTP and XML/JSON, OpenCMIS , JavaScript, and Groovy\nFeed content directly into a JavaScript widget from a CMIS call JSON response, so you can see how content management servers can be accessed directly via AJAX calls from a web application\nIntegrate Drupal with a content management server via CMIS, so Drupal does not have to store documents and images\nIntegrate multiple content management systems in a standard way via an enterprise service bus and a CMIS connector\nHandle advanced concepts such as versioning, permissions, and relationships between content items\nTalk to the Alfresco Cloud service via CMIS, so you can make content available outside the company firewall",

    "description": "Microsoft Windows is one of the two most common OS and managing its security has spawned the discipline of IT security. Kali Linux is the premier platform for testing and maintaining Windows security. Kali is built on the Debian distribution of Linux and shares the legendary stability of that OS. This lets you focus on using the network penetration, password cracking, forensics tools and not the OS.\nThis book has the most advanced tools and techniques to reproduce the methods used by sophisticated hackers to make you an expert in Kali Linux penetration testing. First, you are introduced to Kali s top ten tools and other useful reporting tools. Then, you will find your way around your target network and determine known vulnerabilities to be able to exploit a system remotely. Next, you will prove that the vulnerabilities you have found are real and exploitable. You will learn to use tools in seven categories of exploitation tools. Further, you perform web access exploits using tools like websploit and more. Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. Passwords are often that weak link. Thus, you learn about password attacks that can be used in concert with other approaches to break into and own a network. Moreover, you come to terms with network sniffing, which helps you understand which users are using services you can exploit, and IP spoofing, which can be used to poison a system s DNS cache. Once you gain access to a machine or network, maintaining access is important.\nThus, you not only learn penetrating in the machine you also learn Windows privilege s escalations. With easy to follow step-by-step instructions and support images, you will be able to quickly pen test your system and network.\nWho This Book Is For\nIf you are a working ethical hacker who is looking to expand the offensive skillset with a thorough understanding of Kali Linux, then this is the book for you. Prior knowledge about Linux operating systems and the BASH terminal emulator along with Windows desktop and command line would be highly beneficial.\nWhat You Will LearnSet up Kali Linux for pen testing\nMap and enumerate your Windows network\nExploit several common Windows network vulnerabilities\nAttack and defeat password schemes on Windows\nDebug and reverse-engineer Windows programs\nRecover lost files, investigate successful hacks and discover hidden data in innocent-looking files\nCatch and hold admin rights on the network, and maintain backdoors on the network after your initial testing is done",

    "description": "Are you serious about network security? Then check out SSH, the Secure Shell, which provides key-based authentication and transparent encryption for your network connections. It s reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn t solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively.Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result istransparentencryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a uniquetunnelingcapability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.Written for a wide, technical audience, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you re an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks.No matter where or how you re shipping information, SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide will show you how to do it securely.",

    "description": "Linux is the one of the most powerful and universally adopted OSes. Shell is a program that gives the user direct interaction with the operating system. Scripts are collections of commands that are stored in a file. The shell can read this file and act on the commands as if they were typed on the keyboard. Shell scripting is used to automate day-to-day administration, and for testing or product development tasks.\nThis book covers Bash, GNU Bourne Again SHell, preparing you to work in the exciting world of Linux shell scripting. We start with an introduction to the Shell environment and explain basic commands used in Shell. Next we move on to check, kill, and control the execution of processes in Linux OS. Further, we teach you about the filter tools available in Linux and explain standard output and standard errors devices.\nThen we will ensure you understand Shell s interpretation of commands and get a firmer grasp so you use them in practice. Next, you ll experience some real-world essentials such as debugging and perform Shell arithmetic fluently. Then you ll take a step ahead and learn new and advanced topics in Shell scripting, such as starting up a system and customizing a Linux system. Finally, you ll get to understand the capabilities of scripting and learn about Grep, Stream Editor, and Awk.\nWhat You Will LearnFamiliarize yourself with the various text filtering tools available in Linux\nCombine the fundamental text and file processing commands to process data and automate repetitive tasks\nUnderstand expressions and variables and how to use them practically\nAutomate decision-making and save a lot of time and effort of revisiting code\nGet to grips with advanced functionality such as using traps and signals and using dialogs to develop screens\nStart up a system and customize a Linux system\nTake an in-depth look at regular expressions and pattern matching to understand the capabilities of scripting",

    "description": "NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a set of patches and added utilities to the Linux kernel to incorporate a strong, flexible, mandatory access control architecture into the major subsystems of the kernel. With its fine-grained yet flexible approach, it is no wonder Linux distributions are firing up SELinux as a default security measure.\nSELinux System Administration covers the majority of SELinux features through a mix of real-life scenarios, descriptions, and examples. Everything an administrator needs to further tune SELinux to suit their needs are present in this book.\nThis book touches on various SELinux topics, guiding you through the configuration of SELinux contexts, definitions, and the assignment of SELinux roles, and finishes up with policy enhancements. All of SELinux s configuration handles, be they conditional policies, constraints, policy types, or audit capabilities, are covered in this book with genuine examples that administrators might come across.\nBy the end, SELinux System Administration will have taught you how to configure your Linux system to be more secure, powered by a formidable mandatory access control.\nWhat you will learn from this bookEnable and disable features selectively or even enforce them to a granular level\nInterpret SELinux logging to make security-conscious decisions\nAssign new contexts and sensitivity labels to files and other resources\nWork with mod_selinux to secure web applications\nUse tools like sudo, runcon, and newrole to switch roles and run privileged commands in a safe environment\nUse iptables to assign labels to network packets\nConfigure IPSec and NetLabel to transport SELinux contexts over the wire\nBuild your own SELinux policies using reference policy interfaces",

    "description": "In the 1970s, while their contemporaries were protesting the computer as a tool of dehumanization and oppression, a motley collection of college dropouts, hippies, and electronics fanatics were engaged in something much more subversive. Obsessed with the idea of getting computer power into their own hands, they launched from their garages a hobbyist movement that grew into an industry, and ultimately a social and technological revolution. What they did was invent the personal computer: not just a new device, but a watershed in the relationship between man and machine. This is their story.\nFire in the Valley is the definitive history of the personal computer, drawn from interviews with the people who made it happen, written by two veteran computer writers who were there from the start. Working at InfoWorld in the early 1980s, Swaine and Freiberger daily rubbed elbows with people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when they were creating the personal computer revolution.\nA rich story of colorful individuals, Fire in the Valley profiles these unlikely revolutionaries and entrepreneurs, such as Ed Roberts of MITS, Lee Felsenstein at Processor Technology, and Jack Tramiel of Commodore, as well as Jobs and Gates in all the innocence of their formative years.\nThis completely revised and expanded third edition brings the story to its completion, chronicling the end of the personal computer revolution and the beginning of the post-PC era. It covers the departure from the stage of major players with the deaths of Steve Jobs and Douglas Engelbart and the retirements of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; the shift away from the PC to the cloud and portable devices; and what the end of the PC era means for issues such as personal freedom and power, and open source vs. proprietary software.",

Using the on-board interfaces available, the Raspberry Pi can be expanded to allow the connection of a virtually infinite number of security sensors and devices. The Raspberry Pi has the processing power and interfaces available to build a sophisticated home security system but at a fraction of the cost of commercially available systems.\nBuilding a Home Security System with Raspberry Pi starts off by showing you the Raspberry Pi and how to set up the Linux-based operating system. It then guides you through connecting switch sensors and LEDs to the native GPIO connector safely, and how to access them using simple Bash scripts. As you dive further in, you ll learn how to build an input/output expansion board using the I2C interface and power supply, allowing the connection of the large number of sensors needed for a typical home security setup.\nIn the later chapters of the book, we ll look at more sophisticated topics such as adding cameras, remotely accessing the system using your mobile phone, receiving intrusion alerts and images by e-mail, and more.\nBy the end of the book, you will be well-versed with the use of Raspberry Pi to power a home-based security system that sends message alerts whenever it is triggered and will be able to build a truly sophisticated and modular home security system. You will also gain a good understanding of Raspberry Pi s ecosystem and be able to write the functions required for a security system.",

The majority of both Unix and Linux code is still written at the system level, and Linux System Programming focuses on everything above the kernel, where applications such as Apache, bash, cp, vim, Emacs, gcc, gdb, glibc, ls, mv, and X exist.\nWritten primarily for engineers looking to program (better) at the low level, this book is an ideal teaching tool for any programmer. Even with the trend toward high-level development, either through web software (such as PHP) or managed code (C#), someone still has to write the PHP interpreter and the C# virtual machine. Linux System Programming gives you an understanding of core internals that makes for better code, no matter where it appears in the stack. Debugging high-level code often requires you to understand the system calls and kernel behavior of your operating system, too.\nKey topics include:An overview of Linux, the kernel, the C library, and the C compiler\nReading from and writing to files, along with other basic file I/O operations, including how the Linux kernel implements and manages file I/O\nBuffer size management, including the Standard I/O library\nAdvanced I/O interfaces, memory mappings, and optimization techniques\nThe family of system calls for basic process management\nAdvanced process management, including real-time processes\nFile and directories-creating, moving, copying, deleting, and managing them\nMemory managementinterfaces for allocating memory, managing the memory youhave, and optimizing your memory access\nSignals and their role on a Unix system, plus basic and advanced signal interfaces\nTime, sleeping, and clock management, starting with the basics and continuing through POSIX clocks and high resolution timersWith Linux System Programming, you will be able to take an in-depth look at Linux from both a theoretical and an applied perspective as you cover a wide range of programming topics.",

This book is the element you need to make the jump from journeyman to master.<br />\nAll too often, developers grind through building good apps on willpower and a vigorous focus on code development, leaving them unaware of and unable to benefit from the underlying structural and functional design patterns.\nPro Objective-C Design Patterns for iOS will teach you those design patterns that have always been present at some level in your code, but were never recognized, acknowledged, or fully utilized. Implementation of specific pattern approaches will prove their value to any developer working in the iOS application arena. You\u2019ll learn to master classic patterns like singleton, abstract factory, chain of responsibility, and observer. You\u2019ll also discover less well-known but useful patterns like memento, composite, command, and mediator.",

You ll learn how to deploy a failover cluster to protect against the risk of Hyper-V becoming a single point of failure, and how to make virtual machines fault tolerant. System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) is the preferred tool for managing large Hyper-V deployments, so you ll get to know this next and how it differs from VMware s vCenter solution, as well as how to manage a mixed environment including both vSphere and Hyper-V deployments.\nLike any server migration, a virtual server migration requires careful planning to ensure success. You ll find information here on the specifics of migrating from vSphere to Hyper-V, planning for down time, IP address differences, performance considerations, and more. For migrations to Hyper-V, SCVMM is once again the preferred tool, but you ll also be introduced to some of the excellent free tools available.\nOne easily overlooked aspect of the migration process is the way in which it impacts your backup and recovery strategy. Knowing the best practices here can help you protect your Hyper-V environment.

If your app is difficult to use or doesn t meet their needs, finding another one is just a tap away.\nTo illustrate, consider the ever-growing field of Twitter clients. There are hundreds of variations in the App Store but only a handful stand out from the pack. For most apps, it boils down to one thing: the user experience. The same is true for countless other categories within the App Store; well-designed apps are more likely to attract and retain users. Of course there are other critical aspects of iPhone app development: the coding, the marketing, the customer support. All of the elements must come together.",

However, for a first-time Mac developer, just firing up Xcode and starting to browse the documentation can be a daunting task. The Objective-C class reference documentation alone would fill thousands of printed pages, not to mention all the other tutorials and guides included with Xcode. Where do you start? Which classes are you going to need to use? How do you use Xcode and the rest of the tools?\nThis book answers these questions and more, helping you find your way through the jungle of classes, tools, and new concepts so that you can get started on the next great Mac OS X application today.",

    "description": "The iPhone and iPod touch have provided all software developers with a level playing field\u2014developers working alone have the same access to consumers as multinational software publishers. Very cool indeed! To make your application stand out from the crowd, though, it has to have that something extra. You must learn the skills to take your apps from being App Store filler to download chart-topping blockbusters.<br />\nDevelopers with years of experience helped write this book. Spend some time understanding their code and why they took the approach they did. You will find the writing, illustrations, code, and sample applications second to none. No matter what type of application you are writing, you will find something in this book to help you make your app that little bit cooler.\nThe book opens with Wolfgang Ante, the developer behind the Frenzic puzzle game, showing how timers, animation, and intelligence are used to make game play engaging. It moves on to Rogue Amoeba s Mike Ash explaining how to design a network protocol using UDP, and demonstrating its use in a peer-to-peer application\u2014a topic not normally for the faint of heart, but explained here in a way that makes sense to mere mortals. Gary Bennett then covers the important task of multithreading. Multithreading can be used to keep the user interface responsive while working on other tasks in the background. Gary demonstrates how to do this and highlights traps to avoid along the way.<br />\nNext up, Canis Lupus (aka Matthew Rosenfeld) describes the development of the Keynote-controlling application Stage Hand, how the user interface has evolved, and the lessons he has learned from that experience. Benjamin Jackson then introduces two open source libraries: cocos2d, for 2D gaming; and Chipmunk, for rigid body physics (think \u201ccollisions\u201d). He describes the development of Arcade Hockey, an air hockey game, and explains some of the code used for this.\nNeil Mix of Pandora Radio reveals the science behind processing streaming audio. How do you debug what you can t see? Neil guides you through the toughest challenges, sharing his experience of what works and what to watch out for when working with audio. Finally, Steven Peterson demonstrates a comprehensive integration of iPhone technologies. He weaves Core Location, networking, XML, XPath, and SQLite into a solid and very useful application.\nSoftware development can be hard work. Introductory books lay the foundation, but it can be challenging to understand where to go next. This book shows some of the pieces that can be brought together to make complete, cool applications.",

    "description": "Are you a programmer looking for a new challenge? Does the thought of building your very own iPhone app make your heart race and your pulse quicken? If so, Beginning iPhone 3 Development: Exploring the iPhone SDK is just the book for you. Updated and revised for iPhone SDK 3, many of the discussions in the original book have been clarified to make some of the more complex topics easier to understand. In addition, all of the projects have been rebuilt from scratch using the SDK 3 templates.\nAssuming only a minimal working knowledge of Objective-C, and written in a friendly, easy-to-follow style, this book offers a complete soup-to-nuts course in iPhone and iPod touch programming. The book starts with the basics, walking you through the process of downloading and installing Apple s free iPhone SDK, and then stepping you though the creation of your first simple iPhone application. From there, you ll learn to integrate all the interface elements iPhone users have come to know and love, such as buttons, switches, pickers, toolbars, and sliders. You ll master a variety of design patterns, from the simplest single view to complex hierarchical drill-downs. The confusing art of table building will be demystified, and you ll see how to save your data using the iPhone file system. You ll also learn how to save and retrieve your data using SQLite, iPhone s built-in database management system. In addition, you ll also learn about Core Data, an important persistence mechanism that has just been added with SDK 3.\nAnd there s much more! You ll learn to draw using Quartz 2D and OpenGL ES, add multitouch gestural support (pinches and swipes) to your applications, and work with the camera, photo library, accelerometer, and built-in GPS. You ll discover the fine points of application preferences and learn how to localize your apps for multiple languages. You can discover more about this book, download source code, and find support forums at the book s companion site, at www.iphonedevbook.com.",

    "description": "Most books on operating systems deal with theory while ignoring practice. While the usual principles are covered in detail, the book describes a small, but real UNIX-like operating system: MINIX.\nThe book demonstrates how it works while illustrating the principles behind it. Operating Systems: Design and Implementation Second Edition provides the MINIX source code. The relevant selections of the MINIX code are described in detail. When it first came out, MINIX caused something of a revolution. Within weeks, it had its own newsgroup on USENET, with 40,000 people. Most wanted to make MINIX bigger and fancier. Instead, Linux was created. That has become quite popular, very large, and complicated. MINIX, on the other hand, has remained small and suitable for instruction and example.\nThe book has been revised to include updates in MINIX, which started out as a v 7 unix clone for a floppy-disk only 8088. It is now aimed at 386, 486, and pentium machines and is based on the international posix standard instead of on v7. There are now also versions of MINIX for the Macintosh and SPARC available. Professional programmers will find this book to be a valuable resource and reference book.",

It allows you to automate Telnet, FTP, passwd, rlogin, and hundreds of other applications that normally require human interaction. Using Expect to automate these applications will allow you to speed up tasks and, in many cases, solve new problems that you never would have even considered before.\nFor example, you can use Expect to test interactive programs with no changes to their interfaces. Or wrap interactive programs with Motif-like front-ends to control applications by buttons, scrollbars, and other graphic elements with no recompilation of the original programs.",
