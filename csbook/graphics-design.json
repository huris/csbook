It is necessary to learn for all Linux programmers. This book takes the reader step by step through the complexities of Qt, laying the groundwork that allows the reader to make the step from novice to professional. This book is full of real world examples that can be quickly integrated into a developer\u2019s project. While the reader is assumed to be a beginner at Qt development, they are required to have a working knowledge of C++ programming.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",
