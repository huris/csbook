    "description": "Laszlo in Action is the first comprehensive guide to the Laszlo system and its language LZX. OpenLaszlo is an increasingly popular open-source platform for the development and delivery of rich internet applications across multiple platforms: Flash, DHTML, and J2ME. The dramatic emergence of Ajax over the past year was a first step in the transition from page-oriented HTML web applications towards more full-featured rich internet applications. OpenLaszlo provides another important step in this continuing evolutionary process through the increased productivity resulting from LZX s declarative approach. It provides developers with the tools to create web-based applications offering the usability and interactivity associated with desktop applications, and the low costs associated with web-based deployment. The cross-platform nature of Laszlo LZX applications allows source code with only minimum modifications to run natively on all popular web browsers, on all desktop operating systems, on the Flash platform, and other platforms in the future.\nWritten to address the needs of a wide spectrum of developers, ranging from client-side HTML and JavaScript developers all the way to enterprise-class Java or Rails engineers, this book provides a very hands-on approach towards building applications that solve real-world problems across both the Flash and DHTML platforms. Starting with the fundamentals of Laszlo LZX, the authors quickly move towards applying this knowledge to the design and development of a full-scale application called the Laszlo Market. This provides a working context to assist understanding the underlying concepts of Laszlo LZX and, more importantly, how to apply this knowledge in innovative ways. The construction of the Laszlo Market proceeds over the course of the book illustrating topics starting with an initial wireframe and storyboard design to optimization issues dealing with the application s deployment across the Flash and DHTML platforms.",

The case study is based on a mixture of the author s real-world experiences.<br />\nBecoming Agile also focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. In the early days of Agile, there was a general belief that Agile had to be used in all phases of a project, and that it had to be used in its purest form. Over the last few years, reputable Agile authorities have begun questioning this belief: We re finding that the best deployments of Agile are customized to the realities of a given company.\nBecoming Agile discusses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.",

This applies to writing code\u2015you start off with basic calculations, then move on to the logic that drives a complex game. By the end of this book, you will have the skills to be a capable programmer, or at least know what is involved with how to read and write code.\nAlthough you could go online and find videos and tutorials, there is a distinct advantage when it comes to learning things in order and in one place. Most online tutorials for C# are scattered, disordered, and incohesive. It\u2019s difficult to find a good starting point, and even more difficult to find a continuous list of tutorials to bring you to any clear understanding of the C# programming language.

The four-part treatment spans theory, technology, programs and practice. Theory covers integer arithmetic, additive and subtractive color, greyscales, computational geometry, and a new presentation of discrete Fourier analysis; Technology considers bitmap file structures, scanners, digital cameras, graphic editors, and inkjet printers; Programs develops several processing tools for use in conjunction with a standard Paint graphics editor and supplementary processing tools; Practice discusses 1-bit, greyscale, 4-bit, 8-bit, and 24-bit images for the practice section. Relevant QBASIC code is supplied an accompanying CD and algorithms are listed in the appendix. Readers can attain a level of understanding and the practical insights to obtain optimal use and satisfaction from even the most basic digital-imaging equipment.",

In particular, it reveals the very different timescales over which design and innovation operate, and the way in which design ideas evolve across different research groups, companies and application areas.\nThe capture of photographs with sound is a simple idea, proposed 10 years ago, that has still not become widespread. In this new edition of the seminal 2004 book on Audio photography, the author asks \u201cWhy?\u201d A journey through the book\u2019s citations and related commercial products shows considerable progress in understanding the role of sound in photography, and myriad design experiments to support audio visual storytelling as a new media form. The book is a story in itself about the \u201clong nose of innovation\u201d, and a lesson about the need for patience and persistence in the computer industry. To reinforce this point five of the 2004 chapters are re-published in their original form. Theses describe invariant properties of ambient musical, talking and conversational photographs, and the possibility of playback from paper as well as screen.\nFast Design, Slow Innovation will be of interest to researchers and designers of new media systems and experiences, and to innovation scholars or managers looking for a ten year case study of innovation in action.",

    "description": "The first generation of Digital Natives (DNs) is now growing up.However, these digital natives were rather late starters since; their exposure to computers started when they could master the mouse and the penetration of computers in educational institutions was still very low. Today, a new breed of digital natives is emerging. This new breed includes those individuals who are being introduced from their first instances to the world of wireless devices. One year olds manage to master the intuitive touch interfaces of their tablets whilst sitting comfortably in their baby bouncers. The controller-less interfaces allow these children to interact with a machine in a way which was unconceivable below. Thus, our research investigated the paradigm shift between the different generations of digital natives. We analysed the way in which these two generations differ from each other and we explored how the world needs to change in order to harness the potential of these new digital natives.",

    "description": "As more images and videos are becoming available in compressed formats, researchers have begun designing algorithms for different image operations directly in their domains of representation, leading to faster computation and lower buffer requirements. Image and Video Processing in the Compressed Domain presents the fundamentals, properties, and applications of a variety of image transforms used in image and video compression. It illustrates the development of algorithms for processing images and videos in the compressed domain.\nDeveloping concepts from first principles, the book introduces popular image and video compression algorithms, in particular JPEG, JPEG2000, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and H.264 standards. It also explores compressed domain analysis and performance metrics for comparing algorithms. The author then elucidates the definitions and properties of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), integer cosine transform (ICT), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses core operations, such as image filtering, color enhancement, image resizing, and transcoding of images and videos, that are used in various image and video analysis approaches. He also focuses on other facets of compressed domain analysis, including video editing operations, video indexing, and image and video steganography and watermarking.\nWith MATLAB\u00ae codes on an accompanying CD-ROM, this book takes you through the steps involved in processing and analyzing compressed videos and images. It covers the algorithms, standards, and techniques used for coding images and videos in compressed formats.",

It focuses on giving the reader mastery over the concepts, methods and metrics of digital video coding, so that readers have sufficient understanding to choose and tune coding parameters for optimum results that would suit their particular needs for quality, compression, speed and power.\nThe practical aspects are many: Uploading video to the Internet is only the beginning of a trend where a consumer controls video quality and speed by trading off various other factors. Open source and proprietary applications such as video e-mail, private party content generation, editing and archiving, and cloud asset management would give further control to the end-user.\nDigital video is frequently compressed and coded for easier storage and transmission. This process involves visual quality loss due to typical data compression techniques and requires use of high performance computing systems. A careful balance between the amount of compression, the visual quality loss and the coding speed is necessary to keep the total system cost down, while delivering a good user experience for various video applications. At the same time, power consumption optimizations are also essential to get the job done on inexpensive consumer platforms.\nTrade-offs can be made among these factors, and relevant considerations are particularly important in resource-constrained low power devices. To better understand the trade-offs this book discusses a comprehensive set of engineering principles, strategies, methods and metrics. It also exposes readers to approaches on how to differentiate and rank video coding solutions.",

    "description": "3D Face Modeling, Analysis and Recognition presents methodologies for analyzing shapes of facial surfaces, develops computational tools for analyzing 3D face data, and illustrates them using state-of-the-art applications. The methodologies chosen are based on efficient representations, metrics, comparisons, and classifications of features that are especially relevant in the context of 3D measurements of human faces. These frameworks have a long-term utility in face analysis, taking into account the anticipated improvements in data collection, data storage, processing speeds, and application scenarios expected as the discipline develops further. The book covers face acquisition through 3D scanners and 3D face pre-processing, before examining the three main approaches for 3D facial surface analysis and recognition: facial curves; facial surface features; and 3D morphable models. Whilst the focus of these chapters is fundamentals and methodologies, the algorithms provided are tested on facial biometric data, thereby continually showing how the methods can be applied. Key features: * Explores the underlying mathematics and will apply these mathematical techniques to 3D face analysis and recognition * Provides coverage of a wide range of applications including biometrics, forensic applications, facial expression analysis, and model fitting to 2D images * Contains numerous exercises and algorithms throughout the book",

    "description": "This book is about changing the paradigm of numerical simulation. Until now simulation required the generation of a mesh and this has meant a major effort and also a source of errors. In many cases an accurate description of the problem geometry is available as Computer Aided Design (CAD) data. This book will show how the generation of meshes can be avoided completely by using CAD technology. This includes using CAD data for the description of the geometry of the problem directly without approximation by a mesh and applying the functions that CAD programs use (non-uniform rational B-Splines or NURBS) to the description of the unknown. The book starts with an easy to follow introduction to NURBS and the standard data exchange format used by CAD programs. This is followed by an application to finite element shell analysis. For the modelling of solids the boundary element (BEM) is used since this is the only way mesh generation can be avoided. A computer program written in Octave/MATLAB, that has full 3-D capabilities, is introduced and used to demonstrate various steps in the analysis. Applications are in solid mechanics. Both linear and non-linear analyses are discussed and many practical examples are given. The book is designed to provide a starting point for scientists that want to work in this exciting new area of research and for practitioners to learn how thepainof numerical simulation can be eased.",

    "description": "While the earliest character representations in video games were rudimentary in terms of their presentation and performance, the virtual characters that appear in games today can be extremely complex and lifelike. These are characters that have the potential to make a powerful and emotional connection with gamers. As virtual characters become more intricate and varied, there is a growing need to examine the theory and practice of virtual character design. This book seeks to develop a series of critical frameworks to support the analysis and design of virtual characters.\nVirtual Character Design for Games and Interactive Media covers a breadth of topics to establish a relationship between pertinent artistic and scientific theories and good character design practice. Targeted at students, researchers, and professionals, the book aims to show how both character presentation and character performance can be enhanced through careful consideration of underlying theory.\nThe book begins with a focus on virtual character presentation, underpinned by a discussion of biological, artistic, and sociological principles. Next it looks at the performance of virtual characters, encompassing the psychology of emotion and personality, narrative and game design theories, animation, and acting. The book concludes with a series of applied virtual character design examples. These examples examine the aesthetics of player characters, the design and performance of the wider cast of game characters, and the performance of characters within complex, hyperreal worlds.",

    "description": "Like computing, 3D printing has been around for decades but it was expensive and was only used for making complex prototypes. Now, prices have dropped and third-party printing services such as Shapeways have become available, making the technology available to everyone.<br />\nBlender is an open source modeling and animation program popular in the 3D printing community. 3D printing demands more of a modeler than animation or virtual reality. The model maker must engineer their model to work in the real world. They must keep in mind the particular needs of the materials and printers that they are planning to use to print their model.\nThis practical guide gives Blender users all the information they need to design high-quality 3D printed objects. With a solid exploration of the 3D modeling process, design considerations for 3D printing, plus step-by-step exercises, you will soon be comfortable making 3D objects for real-world enjoyment. Starting with an overview of 3D printing, this guide moves onto to precision measurement, fixing problems in a 3D model, and how to make it light and strong enough for real-world use.\nYou will learn how to scale, build, and detail a model for a 3D printer. You will learn to color and decorate it, as well as making parts precisely in the size you want them, so that multi-part objects fit together smoothly. You will also learn tips on saving money when you have printed your model.",

    "description": "This book describes recent innovations in 3D media and technologies, with coverage of 3D media capturing, processing, encoding, and adaptation, networking aspects for 3D Media, and quality of user experience (QoE). The main contributions are based on the results of the FP7 European Projects ROMEO, which focus on new methods for the compression and delivery of 3D multi-view video and spatial audio, as well as the optimization of networking and compression jointly across the Future Internet (www.ict-romeo.eu).\nThe delivery of 3D media to individual users remains a highly challenging problem due to the large amount of data involved, diverse network characteristics and user terminal requirements, as well as the user\u2019s context such as their preferences and location. As the number of visual views increases, current systems will struggle to meet the demanding requirements in terms of delivery of constant video quality to both fixed and mobile users.\nROMEO will design and develop hybrid-networking solutions that combine the DVB-T2 and DVB-NGH broadcast access network technologies together with a QoE aware Peer-to-Peer (P2P) distribution system that operates over wired and wireless links. Live streaming 3D media needs to be received by collaborating users at the same time or with imperceptible delay to enable them to watch together while exchanging comments as if they were all in the same location.\nThe volume provides state-of-the-art information on 3D multi-view video, spatial audio networking protocols for 3D media, P2P 3D media streaming, and 3D Media delivery across heterogeneous wireless networks among other topics. Graduate students and professionals in electrical engineering and computer science with an interest in 3D Future Internet Media will find this volume to be essential reading.",

This is, in part, due to the lack of literature on the subject matter compared to the massive archives of technical design patterns. It is also due, in part, to the fact that it is human nature to use patterns in a similar manner to stencilstracing the outlines without understanding the edges; every curve, line, twist, and turn in the shapes being drawn. In practice, patterns are often used interchangeably with specific features, copied as-is from one of the popular design pattern and wireframe librariessee a full list in UXPin\u2019s Guide to Wireframing.\nBecause I believe understanding patterns is fundamental to good product design and development, I\u2019ve shared an abundance of these best practices with you to help you as you brainstorm, sketch, wireframe, mockup, and prototype. I\u2019ve seen a beautiful assortment of web applications outfitted with click, scroll, drag-and-drop, hover-enabled visual and functional solutions to the user\u2019s everyday problems.

These technologies have radically reconfigured the process of designing web content and function in the widest possible range of browsing environments, ranging from desktops to mobile devices.Dreamweaver CS6 Mobile and Web Development with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery Mobileis essentially three books in one: an introduction to building websites; Dreamweaver CS6: HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design; and an in-depth explanation of how to build inviting, accessible mobile sites with Dreamweaver CS6, responsive design, and jQuery Mobile. This book serves both as the essential reference for Dreamweaver CS6, and a valuable addition to even the most extensive set of resources for modern web design, with or without Dreamweaver. The book starts off by teaching you to create sites and pages with Dreamweaver CS6 and how to use HTML5 for page structure. Then we will learn some cutting-edge design and animation with CSS3. The book also shows how to create and enhance mobile sites with jQuery Mobile. You will also learn to customize themes with ThemeRoller.Dreamweaver CS6 Mobile and Web Development with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery Mobile Mobilecovers the entire spectrum of web design with Dreamweaver, with an emphasis on multi-media (full screen and mobile) design and jQuery Mobile.",
