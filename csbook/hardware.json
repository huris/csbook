Developing a web site with rich client-side behavior means most developers need to learn a transpiled language like JavaScript or TypeScript. But today you can also develop rich browser applications using the .NET runtime and C# using Blazor. With Blazor you can use all that experience you have amassed over the years, and can use thousands of already existing libraries, right in the browser.Blazor Revealed\u00a0will allow you to create a rich web site experience in no time. You will learn how to build user interfaces, and present data to a user for display and modification, capturing the user\u2019s changes via data binding. The book shows you how to access a rich library of .NET functionality such as a component model for building a composable user interface, including how to develop reusable components that can be used across many pages and web sites. Also covered is data exchange with a server, giving you access to microservices and database services.Blazor provides a fresh take on web development by eliminating the need for you to learn different languages and frameworks for client- and server-side development. Blazor allows C# and .NET to be used on all sides, providing a robust feature set that is well suited toward scalable, enterprise-level applications.\u00a0Blazor Revealed\u00a0gets you started in using this important new toolkit for web application development.What You ll LearnBuild user interfaces and display data for users to edit\nCapture the user\u2019s changes via data binding\nTransfer data back and forth between server and client\nCommunicate with microservices and database services\nDevelop reusable components and assemble them into bigger components\nUse routing to build single page applications (SPAs)\nBuild Blazor libraries that are reusable across applicationsWho This Book Is ForExperienced .NET developers who want to apply their existing skills to building professional quality, client-side web applications that run in any browser. The book is for web developers who want to step away from JavaScript and its complexities, and instead use a proven technology (.NET) that is robust toward creating enterprise-quality applications that scale and are reliable and that provide good user experience.

Development of highly capable computer vision applications in an easy way requires a generic approach. In this approach, Arduino is a perfect tool for interaction with the real world. Moreover, the combination of OpenCV and Arduino boosts the level and quality of practical computer vision applications.\nComputer vision is the next level of sensing the environment. The purpose of this book is to teach you how to develop Arduino-supported computer vision systems that can interact with real life by seeing it.\nThis book will combine the powers of Arduino and computer vision in a generalized, well-defined, and applicable way. The practices and approaches in the book can be used for any related problems and on any platforms. At the end of the book, you should be able to solve any types of real life vision problems with all its components by using the presented approach. Each component will extend your vision with the best practices on the topic.\nIn each chapter, you will find interesting real life practical application examples about the topics in the chapter. To make it grounded, we will build a vision-enabled robot step by step towards the end of the book. You will observe that, even though the contexts of the problems are very different, the approaches to solve them are the same and very easy!\nWho This Book Is For\nIf you are a consumer and hobbyist who has familiarity with the basics of Arduino and wish to learn computer vision programming with Arduino to create intelligent systems, then this book is for you. No knowledge of computer vision programming is required.\nWhat You Will LearnUnderstand the design blocks and the generic architecture of computer vision systems by learning an efficient approach to modelling\nBuild up your skill set of computer vision system design using OpenCV by learning fundamentals, camera selection, data acquisition, filtering, processing, feature extraction and recognition for any specific problem\nLearn the wired and wireless communication capabilities of Arduino and comprehensive best practices to connect it to the OpenCV environment in a platform-independent way\nDiscover how to use Arduino to elegantly interact with real life via physical actions\nSolidify everything you ve learnt by designing and building a computer vision-enabled practical robot from scratch",

    "description": "The Arduino is an open source microcontroller built on a single circuit board that is capable of receiving sensory input from its environment and controlling interactive physical objects. It is also a development environment that allows you to write software to the board, and is programmed in the Arduino programming language. The Arduino has become the most popular microcontroller platform and thus hundreds of projects are being developed using it, from basic to advanced levels.\nThis book will first introduce you to the most important board models of the Arduino family. You will then learn to set up the Arduino software environment. Next, you will work with digital and analog inputs and outputs, manage the time precisely, establish serial communications with other devices in your projects, and even control interrupts to make your project more responsive. Finally, you will be presented with a complete real-world example by utilizing all the concepts learned so far in the book. This will enable you to develop your own microcontroller projects.",

    "description": "In the 1970s, while their contemporaries were protesting the computer as a tool of dehumanization and oppression, a motley collection of college dropouts, hippies, and electronics fanatics were engaged in something much more subversive. Obsessed with the idea of getting computer power into their own hands, they launched from their garages a hobbyist movement that grew into an industry, and ultimately a social and technological revolution. What they did was invent the personal computer: not just a new device, but a watershed in the relationship between man and machine. This is their story.\nFire in the Valley is the definitive history of the personal computer, drawn from interviews with the people who made it happen, written by two veteran computer writers who were there from the start. Working at InfoWorld in the early 1980s, Swaine and Freiberger daily rubbed elbows with people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates when they were creating the personal computer revolution.\nA rich story of colorful individuals, Fire in the Valley profiles these unlikely revolutionaries and entrepreneurs, such as Ed Roberts of MITS, Lee Felsenstein at Processor Technology, and Jack Tramiel of Commodore, as well as Jobs and Gates in all the innocence of their formative years.\nThis completely revised and expanded third edition brings the story to its completion, chronicling the end of the personal computer revolution and the beginning of the post-PC era. It covers the departure from the stage of major players with the deaths of Steve Jobs and Douglas Engelbart and the retirements of Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; the shift away from the PC to the cloud and portable devices; and what the end of the PC era means for issues such as personal freedom and power, and open source vs. proprietary software.",

It runs a Linux operating system, and has connection ports for various peripherals so that it can be hooked up to sensors, motors, cameras, and more. Raspberry Pi has been hugely popular among hardware hobbyists for various projects, including robotics.\nThis book gives you an insight into implementing several creative projects using the peripherals provided by Raspberry Pi. To start, we ll walk through the basic robotics concepts that the world of Raspberry Pi offers us, implementing wireless communication to control your robot from a distance. Next, we demonstrate how to build a sensible and a visionary robot, maximizing the use of sensors and step controllers. After that, we focus on building a wheeled robot that can draw and play hockey. To finish with a bang, we ll build an autonomous hexcopter, that is, a flying robot controlled by Raspberry Pi.\nBy the end of this book, you will be a maestro in applying an array of different technologies to create almost any imaginable robot.",

Scott takes that same highly acclaimed, casual, straight-to-the-point concept and layout and brings it to learning Apple\u2019s amazing iPhone. Scott teams up once again with gadget guru and leading iPhone authority Terry White to put together a book that is an awful lot like the iPhone itself\u2013simple to use and fun to learn. The book\u2019s layout is brilliant, with each page covering just one single topic, so finding the information you need is quick and easy, with a large full-color photo on each page so you can see exactly how it works.\nThe first edition of this book was named Best Computer Book of 2007 and, since then, Scott and Terry have added even more tips and tricks, and made it even easier by focusing on just the most useful and most requested iPhone 4S, 4, and 3GS features (without all the techno-babble), so you can start really using your iPhone today!",

Using the on-board interfaces available, the Raspberry Pi can be expanded to allow the connection of a virtually infinite number of security sensors and devices. The Raspberry Pi has the processing power and interfaces available to build a sophisticated home security system but at a fraction of the cost of commercially available systems.\nBuilding a Home Security System with Raspberry Pi starts off by showing you the Raspberry Pi and how to set up the Linux-based operating system. It then guides you through connecting switch sensors and LEDs to the native GPIO connector safely, and how to access them using simple Bash scripts. As you dive further in, you ll learn how to build an input/output expansion board using the I2C interface and power supply, allowing the connection of the large number of sensors needed for a typical home security setup.\nIn the later chapters of the book, we ll look at more sophisticated topics such as adding cameras, remotely accessing the system using your mobile phone, receiving intrusion alerts and images by e-mail, and more.\nBy the end of the book, you will be well-versed with the use of Raspberry Pi to power a home-based security system that sends message alerts whenever it is triggered and will be able to build a truly sophisticated and modular home security system. You will also gain a good understanding of Raspberry Pi s ecosystem and be able to write the functions required for a security system.",

However, developers are mostly adapting the traditional product development and then adjusting it based on their practical experience on the job. Traditional product development process does not fit well for OSH approach and hence an appropriate process needs to be established, that makes product development with OSH approach easy, effective and fun experience. The author has done extensive research on the nature of OSH, informal practices followed by current OSH developers, experiences shared in forums and blogs, and then used his own experience in process improvements, innovation, new idea generation, project management etc. to come up with a structured process for product development using open source hardware approach. One of the reasons for recent increase in usage of OSH approach is due to OSH component developers\u2019 extra effort in making OSH simple, easy and fun experience. In line with this trend the author has tried to keep the process simple, easy to follow and brief. The author also wants to encourage more and more people to take up product development using OSH approach, and hence has included interesting topics like basic concepts of OSH and why it is required, comparison to traditional product development process, interesting case study etc. By referring to these chapters, not only OSH developers will benefit, but other readers will also be encouraged to take up OSH full/part time and also appreciate the work done by contributors to OSH. Hence the author wishes to have a large readership base, through which he can build a large pool of innovators, developers, students, OSH users and enthusiasts. Below is the listing of the chapters and brief description:Product development process for OSH: steps like idea generation, knowledge sharing, tinkering etc. are explained including the flow of these steps.Difference to traditional process: differences between traditional process and OSH process, advantages etc. are discussed.Advantages and disadvantages of OSH process: advantages and disadvantages of OSH are explained in detail.OSH for DIY projects: basic concepts of OSH based DIY projects and different components are explained.Case Study: interesting case study of building an automated home garden is explained in detail.OSH Components and tools: different components and tools that can be used for OSH product development are explained in detail.Licensing: a brief description of different types of licensing used for OSH products is included.Funding for OSH products: various funding options available for OSH product development is listed out.Best Practices: author has complied different best practices that can be followed while doing OSH product development.Enablers and trends in OSH: to keep the OSH community upto date with whats happening around, the author has included the latest enablers and trend in OSH.Useful References: includes some websites, organizations, books etc. that can be used as further reference materials by readers.OSH Companies and Products: list of successful companies and some products developed using OSH approach are included.",

    "description": "Get Fit with Apple Watch is the concise introduction to the amazing new Apple Watch. It s the first book specifically focused on the Apple Watch s most important function: health and fitness.\nThis book is for you if you are interested in health and are willing to make small lifestyle adjustments in order to enhance health and well-being. This book is also for you if you are a dedicated health junkie who already exercises on a regular basis and follows a healthy diet. The Apple Watch includes fitness apps that you can access right on your wrist while you are exercising, for instant feedback on how you are doing.\nYou will learn how to use the Watch to avoid sitting for too long, to register a healthy amount of body movement every day, and how to get the most out of more strenuous exercise activities. All fitness and exercise-related built-in apps will be covered in detail, as well as leading third party health and fitness apps that have been specifically tailored to work with the Watch.\nPart I plus two appendixes give readers just what they need to know to understand all functionality of the Apple Watch to set up their Apple Watch, and what third-party apps are available (at time of publication). It s a great mini-book that will be appeal to readers who don t feel the need to buy an entire standalone introduction to the Apple Watch.\nPart II (the majority of the book) clearly explains the Apple Watch s fitness and health-tracking functions, but goes well beyond this by showing readers different ways to integrate these functions into their daily lives, regular workout routines, and with their iPhone and the leading third-party health and fitness apps. Plus, there s an entire chapter devoted to the Apple Watch Research Kit, explaining the benefits of the associated medical research apps and how users can participate in these world-changing programs, should they choose to.\nVeteran technology author Allen Taylor is also a participant in the Apple Watch Research Kit study in cardiovascular fitness conducted by Stanford University.",

It is also a development environment that allows the writing of software to the board, and is programmed in the Arduino programming language. It is used for a variety of different purposes and projects, from simple projects such as building a thermostat, to more advanced ones such as robotics, web servers, seismographs, home security systems and synthesizers.\nThis book will demonstrate how the Arduino can be used to develop a highly connected home security system by mobilizing a network of sensors which can feed alerts back to an Arduino when alarms are triggered. You will know the current state of security systems, well supported by the designs that fit best for your environment. Also, we will see some current technologies such as NFC, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and will finally create a complete web interface that will allow us to remotely manage our system, and even send daily bulletins with the summary of activity.\nTowards the end, we ll develop a wireless home security system by setting up security cameras and motion detectors (door and gate trips, temperature sensors). We will then set up a centralized remote access hub (powered by the Arduino) that allows sensors to connect to the wireless home network that can be viewed and interacted by the user.",

These designers will have a fundamental knowledge of processors and other elements in the system, but the success of their design will depend on the skills in making system-level tradeoffs that optimize the cost, performance and other attributes to meet application requirements. This book provides a new treatment of computer system design, particularly for System-on-Chip (SOC), which addresses the issues mentioned above. It begins with a global introduction, from the high-level view to the lowest common denominator (the chip itself), then moves on to the three main building blocks of an SOC (processor, memory, and interconnect). Next is an overview of what makes SOC unique (its customization ability and the applications that drive it). The final chapter presents future challenges for system design and SOC possibilities.",
