    "description": "Scratch is a fun, free, beginner-friendly programming environment where you connect blocks of code to build programs. While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.",

This book shows you how to advance the NXT with more than 45 exciting projects that include creating a cool magic wand that writes words in thin air, building a remotely guided vehicle, and constructing sophisticated robots that can sense color, light, temperature, and more. All projects are explained with easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions, so you ll be able to create them successfully whether you re a novice or an expert. This book also shows you how to expand the programming software and use the alternative language NXC.\nNew input devices\u2015such as keypads, sensors, and even the human body\u2015are covered, along with fun games such as surfing, PONG, and SIMON. On the serious side, there are classic engineering challenges such as controlling an inverted pendulum, making a robot that follows a wall, and building several light-seeking vehicles. Some projects are just entertaining, such as the Etch-A-NXT; others are useful, such as a motorized camera mount that takes panoramic photographs.\nThis second edition accounts for the important changes found in the next generation NXT, and it also covers the original concepts in greater depth. Details are presented for practically unlimited expansion of the NXT inputs and outputs by using the I2C communications bus, and several power amplifier designs allow the NXT outputs to drive bigger motors. Instructions are also included for adapting LEGO Power Functions motors to work directly with the NXT.",

Recent advances in computer technology have led to a new generation of VR devices such as VR headsets. Accordingly, virtual reality poses many new scientific challenges for researchers and professionals.\nThe aim of this book, a manual meant for both designers and users of virtual reality, is to present the current state of knowledge on the use of VR headsets in the most complete way possible. The book is divided into 13 chapters. The objective of the first chapter is to give an introduction to VR and clarify its scope. The next chapter presents a theoretical approach to virtual reality through our Immersion and Interaction methodology also known as3I\u00b2 model\u2019\u2019. Then, a chapter about human senses is necessary to understand the sensorimotor immersion, especially vision. These chapters are followed by several chapters which present the different visual interfaces and the VR headsets currently available on the market. These devices can impart comfort and health problems due to sensorimotor discrepancies. A chapter is devoted to these problems, followed by a chapter that gives a detailed discussion of methods and 32 solutions to dispel, or at least to decrease, VR sickness. The following three chapters present different VR applications that use VR headsets (behavioural sciences, industrial uses and Digital Art) and the final chapter provides conclusions and discusses future VR challenges.",

Access to computer hardware is broken into succinct modules, making it a great choice if you want to develop cross-platform games with ease.\nUsing C++ and SFML technologies, this book will guide you through the techniques and approaches used to generate content procedurally within game development.\nThroughout the course of this book, we ll look at examples of these technologies, starting with setting up a roguelike project using the C++ template. We ll then move on to using RNG with C++ data types and randomly scattering objects within a game map. We will create simple console examples to implement in a real game by creating unique and randomised game items, dynamic sprites, and effects, and procedurally generating game events. Then we will walk you through generating random game maps. At the end, we will have a retrospective look at the project.\nBy the end of the book, not only will you have a solid understanding of procedural generation, but you ll also have a working roguelike game that you will have extended using the examples provided.",

    "description": "With the arrival of Unreal Engine 4, a new wonderful tool was born: Blueprint. This visual scripting tool allows even non-programmers to develop the logic for their games, allowing almost anyone to create entire games without the need to write a single line of code. The range of features you can access with Blueprint script is pretty extensive, making it one of the foremost choices for many game developers.\nUnreal Engine Game Development Blueprints helps you unleash the real power of Unreal by helping you to create engaging and spectacular games. It will explain all the aspects of developing a game, focusing on visual scripting, and giving you all the information you need to create your own games.\nWe start with an introductory chapter to help you move fluidly inside the Blueprint user interface, recognize its different components, and understand any already written Blueprint script. Following this, you will learn how to modify generated Blueprint classes to produce a single player tic-tac-toe game and personalize it.\nNext, you will learn how to create simple user interfaces, and how to extend Blueprints through code. This will help you make an informed decision between choosing Blueprint or code. You will then see the real power of Unreal unleashed as you create a beautiful scene with moving, AI controlled objects, particles, and lights.\nThen, you will learn how to create AI using a behavior tree and a global level Blueprint, how to modify the camera, and how to shoot custom bullets. Finally, you will create a complex game using Blueprintable components complete with a menu, power-up, dangerous objects, and different weapons.",

This is a practical book that will provide you with everything you need to write your own books of Sudoku Classic and Samurai puzzles. But be warned: after reading it, you ll discover that the puzzles in your local paper are not so challenging after all!\nWe like Sudokus because they test our capacity to recognize and interpret patterns. But how are the clues generated? Where do those quasi-symmetrical configurations come from? When the author explored the Web to find out, he discovered that there were many sites that explained how to solve Sudokus, but none that told him how create them. He also saw many sites and apps to play Sudoku, but, perhaps not surprising, no indication of how they worked.\nSo, he had to develop his own applications in order to find out. And, from the very start, he decided that he would publish the code for anyone else to use and perhaps tinker with, but the author wrote it in such a way that also lets readers with limited knowledge of programming techniques understand it. In fact, you could decide to start generating thousands of puzzles almost immediately, and go through the explanations of algorithms and techniques later, a bit at a time. The author chose to write the application in \u2018plain old C\u2019 because he wanted to make the code accessible to as many people as possible.\nIn this book, you will find an explanation of all solving strategies, and the code to implement them. Writing the Solver application was more difficult than writing the Generator, because it required designing and implementing each strategy separately. However, the author wanted to include a solving program capable of listing the strategies necessary to solve any particular puzzle. He also wanted to check whether a puzzle was solvable analytically, without any guessing.\nThis book includes the full listings of both the Generator and the Solver, and explanations of all C modules, with walk-throughs and examples.",

    "description": "The world is becoming increasingly mobile. Smartphones and tablets have become more powerful and popular, with many of these devices now containing confidential business, financial, and personal information. This has led to a greater focus on mobile software security. Establishing mobile software security should be of primary concern to every mobile application developer. This book explains how you can create mobile social applications that incorporate security throughout the development process.\nAlthough there are many books that address security issues, most do not explain how to incorporate security into the building process. Secure Development for Mobile Apps does exactly that. Its step-by-step guidance shows you how to integrate security measures into social apps running on mobile platforms. You\u2019ll learn how to design and code apps with security as part of the process and not an afterthought. The author outlines best practices to help you build better, more secure software.\nThis book provides a comprehensive guide to techniques for secure development practices. It covers PHP security practices and tools, project layout templates, PHP and PDO, PHP encryption, and guidelines for secure session management, form validation, and file uploading. The book also demonstrates how to develop secure mobile apps using the APIs for Google Maps, YouTube, jQuery Mobile, Twitter, and Facebook. While this is not a beginner\u2019s guide to programming, you should have no problem following along if you\u2019ve spent some time developing with PHP and MySQL.",

It discusses many concepts of general purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming and presents practical examples in game programming and scientific programming.\nThe author first describes numerical issues that arise when computing with floating-point arithmetic, including making trade-offs among robustness, accuracy, and speed. He then shows how single instruction multiple data (SIMD) extensions work on CPUs since GPUs also use SIMD.\nThe core of the book focuses on the GPU from the perspective of Direct3D 11 (D3D11) and the High Level Shading Language (HLSL). This chapter covers drawing 3D objects; vertex, geometry, pixel, and compute shaders; input and output resources for shaders; copying data between CPU and GPU; configuring two or more GPUs to act as one; and IEEE floating-point support on a GPU.\nThe book goes on to explore practical matters of programming a GPU, including code sharing among applications and performing basic tasks on the GPU. Focusing on mathematics, it next discusses vector and matrix algebra, rotations and quaternions, and coordinate systems. The final chapter gives several sample GPGPU applications on relatively advanced topics",

    "description": "Game development has traditionally only been accessible to those with experience in computer science and access to the best or most expensive development tools. However, with the advent of technologies such as HTML5 and the ability to self-publish, web-based games such as those on Facebook and smartphones are becoming more attractive to develop than ever before. Through the use of open technologies such as HTML5, anyone with even a basic understanding of games development can begin to develop video games in their spare time and publish them to the Web or as an application for mobile devices.\nInstant HTML5 2D Platformer is a practical, hands-on guide that provides you with a number of clear, step-by-step, task-based exercises, which are used to discuss game development and put into practice development techniques through the use of HTML5 and JavaScript. This book looks at the creation of a 2D platform-based game using the HTML5 canvas element.\nInstant HTML5 2D Platformer introduces you to HTML5 canvas through a number of exercises, which show what the canvas is capable of. The book contains a number of clear, practical, hands-on tasks that incrementally build on the concepts of game creation and result in a 2D HTML5 platform-based game.\nBy undertaking the tasks within this book, you will learn how to develop your own 2D HTML5 game framework that you can use in the creation of your own video games, not just the game developed within this book. Alongside this framework you will learn how to develop and understand 2D animation, game logic, and how to handle user input devices.\nWhat you will learn from this book<br />\n* Develop a multi-browser-compatible HTML5 game<br />\n* Implement a JavaScript-based games framework<br />\n* Handle user input devices<br />\n* Create a game object management system that will be used to represent the player, enemy units, and collectible items<br />\n* Implement your own 2D animation manager system<br />\n* Add sound effects to an HTML5 game<br />\n* Monitor game statistics and reflect this through an HTML5-canvas-based graphical interface\nApproach<br />\nFilled with practical, step-by-step instructions and clear explanations for the most important and useful tasks. The step-by-step approach taken by this book will show you how to develop a 2D HTML5 platformer-based game that you will be able to publish to multiple devices.\nWho this book is written for<br />\nThis book is great for anyone who has an interest in HTML5 games development, and who already has a basic to intermediate grasp on both the HTML markup and JavaScript programming languages. Therefore, due to this requirement, the book will not discuss the inner workings of either of these languages but will instead attempt to describe the functionality of the code present within this book.",

Among the game revolutionaries you ll meet in this book:\n*A game designer at the University of Southern California leading a team to design a video-game version of Thoreau s Walden Pond.\n*A young neuroscientist and game designer whose research onMath Without Wordsis revolutionizing how the subject is\ntaught, especially to students with limited English abilities.\n*A Virginia Tech music instructor who is leading a group of high school-aged boys through the creation of an original opera staged\ntotally in the online game Minecraft.\nExperts argue that games do trulybelieve in you.They focus, inspire and reassure people in ways that many teachers can t. Games give people a chance to learn at their own pace, take risks, cultivate deeper understanding, fail and want to try again right away and ultimately, succeed in ways that too often elude them in school. This book is sure to excite and inspire educators and parents, as well as provoke some passionate debate.",
