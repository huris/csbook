While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more!

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

You can use shaders to turn data into stunning visual effects, and get your hands dirty by building your own shader with this step-by-step introduction to shader development for game and graphics developers. Learn how to make shaders that move, tint, light up, and look awesome, all without cracking open a math textbook.\n<div>\n<div>Practical Shader Development\u00a0teaches the theory behind how shaders work. The book also shows you how to apply that theory to create eye-popping visual effects. You\u2019ll learn to profile and optimize those effects to make sure your projects keep running quickly with all their new visuals. You\u2019ll learn good theory, good practices, and without getting bogged down in the math.\n\n<div>\n<div>Author Kyle Halladay explains the fundamentals of shader development through simple examples and hands-on experiments. He teaches you how to find performance issues in shaders you are using and then how to fix them.

    "description": "\r\n Book Description:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScratch is a fun, free, beginner-friendly programming environment where you connect blocks of code to build programs. While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

You can use shaders to turn data into stunning visual effects, and get your hands dirty by building your own shader with this step-by-step introduction to shader development for game and graphics developers. Learn how to make shaders that move, tint, light up, and look awesome, all without cracking open a math textbook.\n<div>\n<div>Practical Shader Development\u00a0teaches the theory behind how shaders work. The book also shows you how to apply that theory to create eye-popping visual effects. You\u2019ll learn to profile and optimize those effects to make sure your projects keep running quickly with all their new visuals. You\u2019ll learn good theory, good practices, and without getting bogged down in the math.\n\n<div>\n<div>Author Kyle Halladay explains the fundamentals of shader development through simple examples and hands-on experiments. He teaches you how to find performance issues in shaders you are using and then how to fix them.

    "description": "\r\n Book Description:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScratch is a fun, free, beginner-friendly programming environment where you connect blocks of code to build programs. While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

While most famously used to introduce kids to programming, Scratch can make computer science approachable for people of any age. Rather than type countless lines of code in a cryptic programming language, why not use colorful command blocks and cartoon sprites to create powerful scripts?\nIn\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch, author Majed Marji uses Scratch to explain the concepts essential to solving real-world programming problems. The labeled, color-coded blocks plainly show each logical step in a given script, and with a single click, you can even test any part of your script to check your logic. You ll learn how to:<br />\n\u2013Harness the power of repeat loops and recursion<br />\n\u2013Use if/else statements and logical operators to make decisions<br />\n\u2013Store data in variables and lists to use later in your program<br />\n\u2013Read, store, and manipulate user input<br />\n\u2013Implement key computer science algorithms like a linear search and bubble sort\nHands-on projects will challenge you to create an Ohm s law simulator, draw intricate patterns, program sprites to mimic line-following robots, create arcade-style games, and more! Each chapter is packed with detailed explanations, annotated illustrations, guided examples, lots of color, and plenty of exercises to help the lessons stick.\u00a0Learn to Program with Scratch\u00a0is the perfect place to start your computer science journey, painlessly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",
