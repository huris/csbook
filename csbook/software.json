    "description": "The term \u201cdata science\u201d has been widely used to define this new profession that is expected to interpret vast datasets and translate them to improved decision-making and performance. Clojure is a powerful language that combines the interactivity of a scripting language with the speed of a compiled language. Together with its rich ecosystem of native libraries and an extremely simple and consistent functional approach to data manipulation, which maps closely to mathematical formula, it is an ideal, practical, and flexible language to meet a data scientist s diverse needs.\nTaking you on a journey from simple summary statistics to sophisticated machine learning algorithms, this book shows how the Clojure programming language can be used to derive insights from data. Data scientists often forge a novel path, and you ll see how to make use of Clojure s Java interoperability capabilities to access libraries such as Mahout and Mllib for which Clojure wrappers don t yet exist. Even seasoned Clojure developers will develop a deeper appreciation for their language s flexibility!\nYou ll learn how to apply statistical thinking to your own data and use Clojure to explore, analyze, and visualize it in a technically and statistically robust way. You can also use Incanter for local data processing and ClojureScript to present interactive visualisations and understand how distributed platforms such as Hadoop sand Spark s MapReduce and GraphX s BSP solve the challenges of data analysis at scale, and how to explain algorithms using those programming models.\nAbove all, by following the explanations in this book, you ll learn not just how to be effective using the current state-of-the-art methods in data science, but why such methods work so that you can continue to be productive as the field evolves into the future.\nWhat You Will LearnPerform hypothesis testing and understand feature selection and statistical significance to interpret your results with confidence\nImplement the core machine learning techniques of regression, classification, clustering and recommendation\nUnderstand the importance of the value of simple statistics and distributions in exploratory data analysis\nScale algorithms to web-sized datasets efficiently using distributed programming models on Hadoop and Spark\nApply suitable analytic approaches for text, graph, and time series data\nInterpret the terminology that you will encounter in technical papers\nImport libraries from other JVM languages such as Java and Scala\nCommunicate your findings clearly and convincingly to nontechnical colleagues",

Screen shots help you learn visually and quickly become productive. From the best selling author of the Top 100 Tips for Windows 8. Hello, I\u2019m Tim Sievers. I\u2019ve used every Microsoft Operating System (OS) since the days of MS-DOS in the 1980\u2019s and over the years I\u2019ve seen huge improvements in usability and design. I would never have imagined how far PC\u2019s have come since then. However, looking back there were a few bumps along the road, with Windows Vista and more recently Windows 8 being some of the least popular versions of the OS. Vista was a visually stunning OS let down by poor performance on a wide range of hardware, while Windows 8 was a radical redesign that never really took off. Microsoft\u2019s mission with Windows 10 is to combine the best features of Windows 7 and 8 to give the 1.5 billion Windows Users around the world a reason to upgrade. The return of the Start menu and a free upgrade offer for Windows 7 and 8.1 users is a good beginning, but Windows 10 offers so much more. Designed to help you get up to speed quickly, this guide is a collection of the best 100 tips that I have found for Windows 10. Because Windows 10 is built for both touchscreen and traditional computing devices I have included both touchscreen gesture and keyboard/mouse instructions. Also, as a bonus extra, I have included a list of the most common Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts. This handy reference is divided into several categories to help you quickly find the shortcut you need, when you need it. So, whether you\u2019ve just started using Windows 10 or you\u2019ve been using it for a while, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find some useful tips here that will improve your Windows 10 experience.",

A Platform-as-a-Service cloud aims to fulfill this need, allowing developers to work more efficiently as well as allowing DevOps teams to spend less time fulfilling requests for these environments. Join us as we move into the future with OpenShift.\nImplementing OpenShift will walk the reader through how to easily develop and deploy upon an open source OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service. We will then discuss the architecture of the platform so that users have some insight into the inner workings of the environment. We will then take a step away from the user aspect and cover DevOps topics so that we can perform the deployment of our very own open source Platform-as-a-Service using the upstream OpenShift Origin code base.\nDevelopers are no longer in need of provisioning full-scale development environments by provisioning servers, installing and configuring software, and maintaining infrastructure just to write software. This book will show you how developers can move out of this archaic mindset and into the future utilizing OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service technologies, breaking away from the marketing jargon and into the technology that allows developers to get work done. This book also delves into the realm of DevOps, allowing you to run your own environment to support your development teams more efficiently.\nThis book will show you how the OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service can redefine the way web application developers work by providing the building blocks upon which they are able to create their next big idea. From there, the reader will progress through the OpenShift architecture and on to a brisk automated deployment using DevOps technologies.\nYou will learn everything you need to know in order to use OpenShift to develop and deploy applications in the cloud as well as how to deploy your very own OpenShift Origin-based Platform-as-a-Service cloud.",
