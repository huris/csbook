The continuous, rapid growth of data information to volumes of up to terabytes (1,024 gigabytes) or petabytes (1,048,576 gigabytes) means that the need for a system to manage and query information from large scale data sources is becoming more urgent. Currently available frameworks and methodologies are limited in terms of efficiency and querying compatibility between data sources due to the differences in information storage structures. For this research, the authors designed and programmed a framework based on the fundamentals of language integrated query to query existing data sources without the process of data restructuring. A web portal for the framework was also built to enable users to query protein data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and implement it on Microsoft Azure, a cloud computing environment known for its reliability, vast computing resources and cost-effectiveness.",

    "description": "Spatial applications should be developed in the same way that users develop other database applications: by starting with a good data model and using as many of the database features as possible for managing the data. If a task can be done using a database feature like replication, then it should be done using the standard replication technology instead of inventing a new procedure for replicating spatial data. Because Oracle Spatial s offerings are standards compliant, the book shows how Oracle spatial technology can be used to build cross-vendor database solutions.Applying and Extending Oracle Spatialassumes a basic knowledge of Oracle in terms of understanding the SDO_GEOMETRY type, creating tables, indexes and views, executing basic to moderately complex queries and some idea of PL/SQL programming of triggers and stored procedures. The book shows you the clever things that can be done not just with Oracle Spatial on its own, but in combination with other database technologies. This is a great resource book that will convince you to purchase other Oracle technology books on non-spatial specialist technologies because you will finally see that \u201cspatial is not special: it is a small, fun and clever part of a much larger whole\u201d.\nThis book starts with a detailed data model that can be used in land management applications. It then shows different database features that can be used to manage the spatial data just like any other data in the database. It will also walk you through some of the basic concepts of Oracle Spatial that will help you manage the data better in the database. It will also show how PL/SQL and Java stored procedures programming can help you extend and apply spatial data processing to implement the many data management and processing tasks that are typically done via a GIS.\nThis book starts where all database technology books should start: the data model. It then moves on to show the different tools and technologies that can be applied against that data model/database to solve problems such as additional views, replication, triggers and other programming. Finally, the book concludes by showing how standards can be used to implement a data model and processing across more than one vendor s database.\nThis book on applying and extending Oracle Spatial is aimed at broadening how practitioners conceive of and implement spatial data processing. The powerful insightsApplying and Extending Oracle Spatialoffers are not definitive, but they are offerings from two experts who present a powerful understanding on how Oracle Spatial and related technologies offer a platform for spatial data storage and processing that is seldom heard.",

In the event of a failurecatastrophic or otherwiseimmediate recovery is essential. By carefully combining multiple servers, it\u2019s even possible to hide the fact a failure occurred at all. From hardware selection to software stacks and horizontal scalability, this book will help you build a versatile PostgreSQL cluster that will survive crashes, resist data corruption, and grow smoothly with customer demand. It all begins with hardware selection for the skeleton of an efficient PostgreSQL database cluster. Then it\u2019s on to preventing downtime as well as troubleshooting some real life problems that administrators commonly face. Next, we add database monitoring to the stack, using collectd, Nagios, and Graphite. And no stack is complete without replication using multiple internal and external tools, including the newly released pglogical extension.

    "description": "Learn the many design decisions that must be made before starting to build a large Oracle Application Express (APEX) application for the cloud or enterprise.One of APEX s key strengths is the fact that it is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool. This is also a major weakness when it tempts developers to start coding too soon. Small applications that consist of tens of pages can be coded without a lot of design work because they can be re-factored quickly when design flaws are discovered. Design flaws in large cloud and enterprise applications that consist of hundreds or thousands of pages are not so easy to re-factor due to the time needed to redevelop and retest the application, not to mention the risk of breaking functionality in subtle ways.Designing a large application before coding starts is a profitable exercise because a thoughtful design goes a long way in mitigating cost overruns and schedule slippage while simultaneously enhancing quality. This book\u00a0takes into account perspectives from other non-developer stakeholders such as maintenance developers, business analysts, testers, technical writers, end users, and business owners. Overlooking these perspectives is one of the chief causes of expensive rework late in the development cycle.Oracle Application Express by Design\u00a0illustrates APEX design principles by using architecture diagrams, screen shots, and explicit code snippets to guide developers through the many design choices and complex interrelationship issues that must be evaluated before embarking on large APEX projects. This book:Guides you through important, up-front APEX design decisions\nHelps you to optimize your design by keeping all stakeholders in mind\nExplicit code examples show how design impacts cost, schedule, and qualityWhat You Will LearnPick and choose from the list of designs before coding begins\nBake optimal quality into the underlying fabric of an APEX application\nThink and design from outside the developer\u2019s narrow perspective\nOptimize APEX application designs to satisfy multiple stakeholder groups\nEvaluate design options through hands-on, explicit code examples\nDefine and measure success for large cloud and enterprise APEX applicationsWho This Book Is ForAPEX developers and development teams",

    "description": "Design great databases\u2015from logical data modeling through physical schema definition. You will learn a framework that finally cracks the problem of merging data and process models into a meaningful and unified design that accounts for how data is actually used in production systems.Key to the framework is a method for taking the logical data model that is a static look at the definition of the data, and merging that static look with the process models describing how the data will be used in actual practice once a given system is implemented. The approach solves the disconnect between the static definition of data in the logical data model and the dynamic flow of the data in the logical process models.The design framework in this book can be used to create operational databases for transaction processing systems, or for data warehouses in support of decision support systems. The information manager can be a flat file, Oracle Database, IMS, NoSQL, Cassandra, Hadoop, or any other DBMS.Usage-Driven Database Design emphasizes practical aspects of design, and speaks to what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and what to avoid at all costs. Included in the book are lessons learned by the author over his 30+ years in the corporate trenches. Everything in the book is grounded on good theory, yet demonstrates a professional and pragmatic approach to design that can come only from decades of experience.Presents an end-to-end framework from logical data modeling through physical schema definition.\nIncludes lessons learned, techniques, and tricks that can turn a database disaster into a success.\nApplies to all types of database management systems, including NoSQL such as Cassandra and Hadoop, and mainstream SQL databases such as Oracle and SQL ServerWhat You ll LearnCreate logical data models that accurately reflect the real world of the user\nCreate usage scenarios reflecting how applications will use a new database\nMerge static data models with dynamic process models to create resilient yet flexible database designs\nSupport application requirements by creating responsive database schemas in any database architecture\nCope with big data and unstructured data for transaction processing and decision support systems\nRecognize when relational approaches won\u2019t work, and when to turn toward NoSQL solutions such as Cassandra or Hadoop",

It is aimed at researchers with their own data ready to be analyzed and at students who would like an approachable alternative view of the subject.\nEach new topic in categorical data analysis is illustrated with an example that readers can apply to their own sets of data. In many cases, R code is given and excerpts from the resulting output are presented. In the context of log-linear models for cross-tabulations, two specialties of the house have been included: the use of cobweb diagrams to get visual information concerning significant interactions, and a procedure for detecting outlier category combinations. The R code used for these is available and may be freely adapted. In addition, this book:\n\u2022 Uses an example to illustrate each new topic in categorical data\n\u2022 Provides a clear explanation of an important subject\n\u2022 Is understandable to most readers with minimal statistical and mathematical backgrounds\n\u2022 Contains examples that are accompanied by R code and resulting output\n\u2022 Includes starred sections that provide more background details for interested readers\nCategorical Data Analysis by Example is a reference for students in statistics and researchers in other disciplines, especially the social sciences, who use categorical data.

On the Ops side, DBAs perform release and troubleshooting activities in support of the application, manage the data platform\u2019s access and security, and monitor and maintain performance of the databases that they have designed and provisioned.\nDevOps, DBAs, and DBaaS investigates the complex intersection between DBA functions and DevOps processes. DevOps teams traditionally viewed DBAs as process outliers who disrupt and retard SDLC timelines. At each touch point, veteran DBA Mike Cuppett shows how DBAs can most effectively contribute to decreasing release cycle times and improving product resiliency by applying automation, orchestration, and DBaaS solutions to database administration in ways that dovetail with DevOps requirements and metrics.\nAt a high level, Cuppett demonstrates the importance of leveling silo walls in the IT supply chain and of measuring application performance holistically by reference to satisfaction of customer requirements and end-user experience.

    "description": "Speed up the execution of important database queries by making good choices about which indexes to create. Choose correct index types for different scenarios. Avoid indexing pitfalls that can actually have indexes hurting performance rather than helping. Maintain indexes so as to provide consistent and predictable query response over the lifetime of an application.\nExpert Oracle Indexing and Access Paths\u00a0is about the one database structure at the heart of almost all performance concerns: the index. Database system performance is one of the top concerns in information technology today. Administrators struggle to keep up with the explosion of access and activity driven by the proliferation of computing into everything from phones to tablets to PCs in our increasingly connected world. At the heart of any good-performing database lies a sound indexing strategy that makes appropriate use of indexing, and especially of the vendor-specific indexing features on offer.\nFew databases fully exploit the wealth of data access mechanisms provided by Oracle.\u00a0Expert Oracle Indexing and Access Paths\u00a0helps by bringing together information on indexing and how to use it into one blissfully short volume that you can read quickly and have at your fingertips for reference. Learn the different types of indexes available and when each is best applied. Recognize when queries aren\u2019t using indexes as you intend. Manage your indexing for maximum performance. Confidently use the In Memory column store feature as an alternate access path to improve performance.

    "description": "Type inheritance is that phenomenon according to which we can say, for example, that every square is also a rectangle, and so properties that apply to rectangles in general apply to squares in particular. In other words, squares are a subtype of rectangles, and rectangles are a supertype of squares. Recognizing and acting upon such subtype / supertype relationships provides numerous benefits: Certainly it can help in data modeling, and it can also provide for code reuse in applications. For these reasons, many languages, including the standard database language SQL, have long supported such relationships. However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any consensus in the community at large on a formal, rigorous, and abstract model of inheritance. This book proposes such a model, one that enjoys several advantages over other approaches, not the least of which it is that it\u2019s fully compatible with the well known relational model of data.\nTopics the model covers include:Both single and multiple inheritance\nScalar, tuple, and relation inheritance\nType lattices and union and intersection types\nPolymorphism and substitutability\nCompile time and run time bindingAll of these topics are described in detail in the book, with numerous illustrative examples, exercises, and answers. The book also discusses several alternative approaches. In particular, it includes a detailed discussion and analysis of inheritance as supported in the SQL standard.",

    "description": "Data clustering is a highly interdisciplinary field, the goal of which is to divide a set of objects into homogeneous groups such that objects in the same group are similar and objects in different groups are quite distinct. Thousands of theoretical papers and a number of books on data clustering have been published over the past 50 years. However, few books exist to teach people how to implement data clustering algorithms. This book was written for anyone who wants to implement or improve their data clustering algorithms.\nUsing object-oriented design and programming techniques, Data Clustering in C++ exploits the commonalities of all data clustering algorithms to create a flexible set of reusable classes that simplifies the implementation of any data clustering algorithm. Readers can follow the development of the base data clustering classes and several popular data clustering algorithms. Additional topics such as data pre-processing, data visualization, cluster visualization, and cluster interpretation are briefly covered.\nThis book is divided into three partsData Clustering and C++ Preliminaries: A review of basic concepts of data clustering, the unified modeling language, object-oriented programming in C++, and design patterns\nA C++ Data Clustering Framework: The development of data clustering base classes\nData Clustering Algorithms: The implementation of several popular data clustering algorithmsA key to learning a clustering algorithm is to implement and experiment the clustering algorithm. Complete listings of classes, examples, unit test cases, and GNU configuration files are included in the appendices of this book as well as in the CD-ROM of the book. The only requirements to compile the code are a modern C++ compiler and the Boost C++ libraries.",

This book covers the best-practice design approaches to re-architecting your relational applications and transforming your relational data to optimize concurrency, security, denormalization, and performance.\nWinner of IBM\u2019s 2012 Gerstner Award for his implementation of big data and data warehouse initiatives and author ofPractical Hadoop Security, author Bhushan Lakhe walks you through the entire transition process. First, he lays out the criteria for deciding what blend of re-architecting, migration, and integration between RDBMS and HDFS best meets your transition objectives. Then he demonstrates how to design your transition model.\nLakhe proceeds to cover the selection criteria for ETL tools, the implementation steps for migration with SQOOP- and Flume-based data transfers, and transition optimization techniques for tuning partitions, scheduling aggregations, and redesigning ETL. Finally, he assesses the pros and cons of data lakes and Lambda architecture as integrative solutions and illustrates their implementation with real-world case studies.\nHadoop/NoSQL solutions do not offer by default certain relational technology features such as role-based access control, locking for concurrent updates, and various tools for measuring and enhancing performance. Practical Hadoop Migration shows how to use open-source tools to emulate such relational functionalities in Hadoop ecosystem components.\nWhat You ll LearnThe requirements and design methodologies of relational data and NoSQL models\nHow to decide whether you should migrate your relational applications to big data technologies or integrate them\nHow to transition your relational applications to Hadoop/NoSQL platforms in terms of logical design and physical implementation\nRDBMS-to-HDFS integration, data transformation, and optimization techniques\nThe situations in which Lambda architecture and data lake solutions should be considered\nHow to select and implement Hadoop-based components and applications to speed transition, optimize integrated performance, and emulate relational functionalities",

    "price": 165,
    "description": "MDX-related books often dedicate a significant part of their content to explaining the concepts of multidimensional cubes, the MDX language and its functions, and other specifics related to working with Analysis Services. And that s perfectly fine, there should be books like that, the tutorials that teach the concepts. However, that also means that when it comes to examples, there s usually not enough space to provide all the details about them and their variations, otherwise the book would become huge or oftentimes lose its focus. The result of that is that making a step further from the provided calculations and queries might not be an easy task for an average reader. The other problem with tutorials is that the solution to a particular problem might be scattered throughout the book, which is where the cookbook style of books like this one come into play. Similar to data warehouses where we consolidate many tables of the relational database into a few and then organize those dimension tables in a topic-based star schema, in cookbooks we aggregate the information about a particular problem in form of one or more recipes and present that topic-based knowledge in full detail. Both the relational databases and the data warehouses have their purpose; it s not uncommon to see them together in one place. The same is true about books and their approaches. What we also know is that there are far too few data warehouses than relational databases. Again, the same is with MDX-related cookbooks in respect to MDX tutorials, particularly those dealing with advanced topics. As a writer, I hope you recognize my intention and the value this book could bring you. As a reader, we rarely have enough time to start reading a book, not to mention f nish it. This is another advantage of the cookbook format. You can browse through the contents and look for the solution to a particular problem. As the recipes are relatively short and organized in chapters, that task won t take much of your time. All the information will be in one place. In addition to that, you ll see which recipes are related to that one, so that you can learn even more.",

The need to cultivate and enlist the public\u2019s trust in the abilities of particular scientists and scientific institutions constitutes one of this book\u2019s major themes. The advent of the Internet, the mass digitization of research information, and social media brought about, among many other things, the ability to harvest \u2013 sometimes implicitly \u2013 a wealth of human genomic, biological, behavioral, economic, political, and social data for the purposes of scientific research as well as commerce, government affairs, and social interaction. What type of ethical dilemmas did such changes generate? How should scientists collect, manipulate, and disseminate this information? The effects of this revolution and its ethical implications are wide-ranging. This book includes the opinions of myriad investigators, practitioners, and stakeholders in big data on human beings who also routinely reflect on the privacy and ethical issues of this phenomenon. Dedicated to the practice of ethical reasoning and reflection in action, the book offers a range of observations, lessons learned, reasoning tools, and suggestions for institutional practice to promote responsible big data research on human affairs. It caters to a broad audience of educators, researchers, and practitioners. Educators can use the volume in courses related to big data handling and processing. Researchers can use it for designing new methods of collecting, processing, and disseminating big data, whether in raw form or as analysis results. Lastly, practitioners can use it to steer future tools or procedures for handling big data. As this topic represents an area of great interest that still remains largely undeveloped, this book is sure to attract significant interest by filling an obvious gap in currently available literature.",

Cassandra is perfect for managing large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across multiple data centers and the cloud. Cassandra delivers linear scalability and performance across many commodity servers with no single point of failure.\nThis book starts by explaining how to derive the solution, basic concepts, and CAP theorem. You will learn how to install and configure a Cassandra cluster as well as tune the cluster for performance. After reading the book, you should be able to understand why the system works in a particular way, and you will also be able to find patterns (and/or use cases) and anti-patterns which would potentially cause performance degradation. Furthermore, the book explains how to configure Hadoop, vnodes, multi-DC clusters, enabling trace, enabling various security features, and querying data from Cassandra.\nStarting with explaining about the trade-offs, we gradually learn about setting up and configuring high performance clusters. This book will help the administrators understand the system better by understanding various components in Cassandra\u2019s architecture and hence be more productive in operating the cluster. This book talks about the use cases and problems, anti-patterns, and potential practical solutions as opposed to raw techniques. You will learn about kernel and JVM tuning parameters that can be adjusted to get the maximum use out of system resources.\nWhat you will learn from this bookExplore trade-offs and basic concepts\nInstall Cassandra, choose hardware, and configure the cluster\nQuery and insert data and CQL\nGet to grips with performance tuning\nFind out about Hadoop integration and evolving apps\nDiscover anti-patterns and how to secure your cluster",

    "description": "This book proposes a data-driven methodology using multi-way data analysis for the design of video-quality metrics. It also enables video- quality metrics to be created using arbitrary features. This data- driven design approach not only requires no detailed knowledge of the human visual system, but also allows a proper consideration of the temporal nature of video using a three-way prediction model, corresponding to the three-way structure of video. Using two simple example metrics, the author demonstrates not only that this purely data- driven approach outperforms state-of-the-art video-quality metrics, which are often optimized for specific properties of the human visual system, but also that multi-way data analysis methods outperform the combination of two-way data analysis methods and temporal pooling.",

This guide is indispensable for intermediate- to advanced level Web designers who want to replace their static sites with something dynamic. In this edition, the bulk of the new material covers the latest versions of both technologies: PHP 6 (due out in 2008) and MySQL 5 (available now). The book s publication date is likely to beat the official release of PHP 6, making it one of the first books available on the subject.",

    "description": "The current social and economic context increasingly demands open data to improve scientific research and decision making. However, when published data refer to individual respondents, disclosure risk limitation techniques must be implemented to anonymize the data and guarantee by design the fundamental right to privacy of the subjects the data refer to. Disclosure risk limitation has a long record in the statistical and computer science research communities, who have developed a variety of privacy-preserving solutions for data releases. This Synthesis Lecture provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of privacy in data releases focusing on the computer science perspective. Specifically, we detail the privacy models, anonymization methods, and utility and risk metrics that have been proposed so far in the literature. Besides, as a more advanced topic, we identify and discuss in detail connections between several privacy models (i.e., how to accumulate the privacy guarantees they offer to achieve more robust protection and when such guarantees are equivalent or complementary); we also explore the links between anonymization methods and privacy models (how anonymization methods can be used to enforce privacy models and thereby offer ex ante privacy guarantees). These latter topics are relevant to researchers and advanced practitioners, who will gain a deeper understanding on the available data anonymization solutions and the privacy guarantees they can offer.",

You will learn how to use Spark for different types of big data analytics projects, including batch, interactive, graph, and stream data analysis as well as machine learning. In addition, this book will help you become a much sought-after Spark expert.\nSpark is one of the hottest Big Data technologies. The amount of data generated today by devices, applications and users is exploding. Therefore, there is a critical need for tools that can analyze large-scale data and unlock value from it. Spark is a powerful technology that meets that need. You can, for example, use Spark to perform low latency computations through the use of efficient caching and iterative algorithms; leverage the features of its shell for easy and interactive Data analysis; employ its fast batch processing and low latency features to process your real time data streams and so on. As a result, adoption of Spark is rapidly growing and is replacing Hadoop MapReduce as the technology of choice for big data analytics.\nThis book provides an introduction to Spark and related big-data technologies. It covers Spark core and its add-on libraries, including Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, GraphX, and MLlib. Big Data Analytics with Spark is therefore written for busy professionals who prefer learning a new technology from a consolidated source instead of spending countless hours on the Internet trying to pick bits and pieces from different sources.\nThe book also provides a chapter on Scala, the hottest functional programming language, and the program that underlies Spark. You\u2019ll learn the basics of functional programming in Scala, so that you can write Spark applications in it.<br />\nWhat s more, Big Data Analytics with Spark provides an introduction to other big data technologies that are commonly used along with Spark, like Hive, Avro, Kafka and so on. So the book is self-sufficient; all the technologies that you need to know to use Spark are covered. The only thing that you are expected to know is programming in any language.\nThere is a critical shortage of people with big data expertise, so companies are willing to pay top dollar for people with skills in areas like Spark and Scala. So reading this book and absorbing its principles will provide a boost\u2015possibly a big boost\u2015to your career.",

This book demonstrates how data processing can be done at scale from the usage of NoSQL datastores to the combination of Big Data distribution.\nWhen the data processing is too complex and involves different processing topology like long running jobs, stream processing, multiple data sources correlation, and machine learning, it\u2019s often necessary to delegate the load to Hadoop or Spark and use the No-SQL to serve processed data in real time.\nThis book shows you how to choose a relevant combination of big data technologies available within the Hadoop ecosystem. It focuses on processing long jobs, architecture, stream data patterns, log analysis, and real time analytics. Every pattern is illustrated with practical examples, which use the different open sourceprojects such as Logstash, Spark, Kafka, and so on.\nTraditional data infrastructures are built for digesting and rendering data synthesis and analytics from large amount of data. This book helps you to understand why you should consider using machine learning algorithms early on in the project, before being overwhelmed by constraints imposed by dealing with the high throughput of Big data.\nScalable Big Data Architecture is for developers, data architects, and data scientists looking for a better understanding of how to choose the most relevant pattern for a Big Data project and which tools to integrate into that pattern.",

    "description": "This edited volume is devoted to Big Data Analysis from a Machine Learning standpoint as presented by some of the most eminent researchers in this area.\nIt demonstrates that Big Data Analysis opens up new research problems which were either never considered before, or were only considered within a limited range. In addition to providing methodological discussions on the principles of mining Big Data and the difference between traditional statistical data analysis and newer computing frameworks, this book presents recently developed algorithms affecting such areas as business, financial forecasting, human mobility, the Internet of Things, information networks, bioinformatics, medical systems and life science. It explores, through a number of specific examples, how the study of Big Data Analysis has evolved and how it has started and will most likely continue to affect society. While the benefits brought upon by Big Data Analysis are underlined, the book also discusses some of the warnings that have been issued concerning the potential dangers of Big Data Analysis along with its pitfalls and challenges.",

With the deluge of information that enterprises face given their global operations and complex business models, as well as the advent of big data technology, it is not surprising that making sense of the large piles of data is of paramount importance. Enterprises must therefore put much greater emphasis on managing and monetizing both structured and unstructured data.\nAs Saumya Chaki\u2015an information management expert and consultant with IBM\u2015explains in Enterprise Information Management in Practice, it is now more important than ever before to have an enterprise information strategy that covers the entire life cycle of information and its consumption while providing security controls.\nWith Fortune 100 consultant Saumya Chaki as your guide, Enterprise Information Management in Practice covers each of these and the other pillars of EIM in depth, which provide readers with a comprehensive view of the building blocks for EIM.\nEnterprises today deal with complex business environments where information demands take place in real time, are complex, and often serve as the differentiator among competitors.

Written by the world\u2019s foremost PowerPivot blogger and practitioner, the book\u2019s concepts and approach are introduced in a simple, step-by-step manner tailored to the learning style of Excel users everywhere. The techniques presented allow users to produce, in hours or even minutes, results that formerly would have taken entire teams weeks or months to produce. It includes lessons on the difference between calculated columns and measures; how formulas can be reused across reports of completely different shapes; how to merge disjointed sets of data into unified reports; how to make certain columns in a pivot behave as if the pivot were filtered while other columns do not; and how to create time-intelligent calculations in pivot tables such as \u201cYear over Year\u201d and \u201cMoving Averages\u201d whether they use a standard, fiscal, or a complete custom calendar. The \u201cpattern-like\u201d techniques and best practices contained in this book have been developed and refined over two years of onsite training with Excel users around the world, and the key lessons from those seminars costing thousands of dollars per day are now available to within the pages of this easy-to-follow guide. This updated second edition covers new features introduced with Office 2015.",

    "description": "The big data era is upon us: data are being generated, analyzed, and used at an unprecedented scale, and data-driven decision making is sweeping through all aspects of society. Since the value of data explodes when it can be linked and fused with other data, addressing the big data integration (BDI) challenge is critical to realizing the promise of big data. BDI differs from traditional data integration along the dimensions of volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. First, not only can data sources contain a huge volume of data, but also the number of data sources is now in the millions. Second, because of the rate at which newly collected data are made available, many of the data sources are very dynamic, and the number of data sources is also rapidly exploding. Third, data sources are extremely heterogeneous in their structure and content, exhibiting considerable variety even for substantially similar entities. Fourth, the data sources are of widely differing qualities, with significant differences in the coverage, accuracy and timeliness of data provided. This book explores the progress that has been made by the data integration community on the topics of schema alignment, record linkage and data fusion in addressing these novel challenges faced by big data integration. Each of these topics is covered in a systematic way: first starting with a quick tour of the topic in the context of traditional data integration, followed by a detailed, example-driven exposition of recent innovative techniques that have been proposed to address the BDI challenges of volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Finally, it presents merging topics and opportunities that are specific to BDI, identifying promising directions for the data integration community.",

The book examines U.S. counterterrorism history, technologies, and strategies from a unique and thought-provoking approach that encompasses personal experiences, investigative journalism, historical and current events, ideas from great thought leaders, and even the make-believe of Hollywood. Demystifying Total Information Awareness, the author expounds on the U.S. intelligence community, artificial intelligence in data mining, social media and privacy, cyber attacks and prevention, causes and cures for terrorism, and longstanding issues of war and peace.\nThe book offers practical advice for businesses, governments, and individuals to better secure the world and protect cyberspace. It quotes U.S. Navy Admiral and NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis: \u201cInstead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.\u201d The book also provides a glimpse into the future of Plan X and Generation Z, along with an ominous prediction from security advisor Marc Goodman at TEDGlobal 2012: \u201cIf you control the code, you control the world.\u201d\nCounterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness will keep you up at night but at the same time give you some peace of mind knowing that \u201cour problems are manmade \u2015 therefore they can be solved by man [or woman],\u201d as President John F.

    "description": "The manipulation of databases is an integral part of a world which is becoming increasingly and pervasively information-focused. This book puts forward a suggestion to advocate preference queries and fuzzy sets as a central concern in database queries and offers an important contribution to the design of intelligent information systems. It provides a comprehensive study on fuzzy preference queries in the context of relational databases. Preference queries, a recent hot topic in database research, provide a basis for rank-ordering the items retrieved, which is especially valuable for large sets of answers.<br />\nThis book aims to show that fuzzy set theory constitutes a highly expressive framework for modeling preference queries. It presents a study of the algorithmic aspects related to the evaluation of such queries in order to demonstrate that this framework offers a good trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Numerous examples and proofs are liberally and lucidly demonstrated throughout, and greatly enhance the detailed theoretical aspects explored in the book.\nResearchers working in databases will greatly benefit from this comprehensive and up-to-date study of fuzzy preference queries, and it will also become an invaluable reference point for postgraduate students interested in advanced database techniques.\nReadership: Postgraduate students and researchers interested in advanced database techniques and database practitioners.",

    "description": "Bayesian Inference provides a unified framework to deal with all sorts of uncertainties when learning patterns form data using machine learning models and use it for predicting future observations. However, learning and implementing Bayesian models is not easy for data science practitioners due to the level of mathematical treatment involved. Also, applying Bayesian methods to real-world problems requires high computational resources. With the recent advances in computation and several open sources packages available in R, Bayesian modeling has become more feasible to use for practical applications today. Therefore, it would be advantageous for all data scientists and engineers to understand Bayesian methods and apply them in their projects to achieve better results.\nLearning Bayesian Models with R starts by giving you a comprehensive coverage of the Bayesian Machine Learning models and the R packages that implement them. It begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of probability theory and R programming for those who are new to the subject. Then the book covers some of the important machine learning methods, both supervised and unsupervised learning, implemented using Bayesian Inference and R.\nEvery chapter begins with a theoretical description of the method explained in a very simple manner. Then, relevant R packages are discussed and some illustrations using data sets from the UCI Machine Learning repository are given. Each chapter ends with some simple exercises for you to get hands-on experience of the concepts and R packages discussed in the chapter.\nThe last chapters are devoted to the latest development in the field, specifically Deep Learning, which uses a class of Neural Network models that are currently at the frontier of Artificial Intelligence. The book concludes with the application of Bayesian methods on Big Data using the Hadoop and Spark frameworks.",

    "description": "This book is about how to write the best software code inside a relational database. The major goal is to reveal the opposition between two possible styles of development. The first style is specific to application developers. It is an atomic, row and procedural oriented style inspired by the structured models of programming. This is the classic style of programming. Many application developers write in the relational database exactly like in the user interface. By opposition, the other style of development is holistic, data set and SQL oriented. This is the style of a database developer. The purpose of the book is to compare the two styles and to promote the holistic style of development as the most suitable one. Secondly, the set based and holistic style of development is not promoted enough in universities and many application developers are not fully aware of it. There are many performance issues all over the world in relational databases due to the use of the atomic and inappropriate style of programming. The book addresses especially to application developers who write atomically in relational databases, but also to students in IT universities who should be aware of the two alternate styles of development. A good developer should realize the difference between the two specific styles and should be able to change something in the way of writing code when switching to a relational database. The first part of the book is conceptual. The goal is to explain, describe and compare the two styles of development. The second part is highly practical. I described a series of practices, taken from two popular systems like Oracle and SQL Server. I imagined many business scenarios, I described them and I solved them in the two opposite approaches. I showed that, in most of the cases, a holistic solution is available as an alternative to an atomic one. This is also a book about performance. For a good performance inside a relational database, the first thing that should be done is to write correctly. And writing correctly means writing differently and specific, means writing holistic and set based. The first prerequisite for a good performance is the use of most suitable style of development. The style of development is a vague concept, but a critical one. We, as programmers, should all be aware of our styles and try to be dynamic and adopt the most suitable style according to our needs.",

    "description": "For all the buzz about trendy IT techniques, data processing is still at the core of our systems, especially now that enterprises all over the world are confronted with exploding volumes of data. Database performance has become a major headache, and most IT departments believe that developers should provide simple SQL code to solve immediate problems and let DBAs tune anybad SQLlater.\nIn The Art of SQL, author and SQL expert Stephane Faroult argues that thissafe approachonly leads to disaster. His insightful book, named after Art of War by Sun Tzu, contends that writing quick inefficient code is sweeping the dirt under the rug. SQL code may run for 5 to 10 years, surviving several major releases of the database management system and on several generations of hardware. The code must be fast and sound from the start, and that requires a firm understanding of SQL and relational theory.\nThe Art of SQL offers best practices that teach experienced SQL users to focus on strategy rather than specifics. Faroult s approach takes a page from Sun Tzu s classic treatise by viewing database design as a military campaign. You need knowledge, skills, and talent. Talent can t be taught, but every strategist from Sun Tzu to modern-day generals believed that it can be nurtured through the experience of others. They passed on their experience acquired in the field through basic principles that served as guiding stars amid the sound and fury of battle. This is what Faroult does with SQL.\nLike a successful battle plan, good architectural choices are based on contingencies. What if the volume of this or that table increases unexpectedly? What if, following a merger, the number of users doubles? What if you want to keep several years of data online? Faroult s way of looking at SQL performance may be unconventional and unique, but he s deadly serious about writing good SQL and using SQL well. The Art of SQL is not a cookbook, listing problems and giving recipes. The aim is to get you-and your manager-to raise good questions.",

After reading this book, you will not only be able to efficiently manage and check the validity of your datasets with the split-apply-combine strategy, but you will also learn to handle larger datasets.\nThis book starts with describing the R object s mode and class, and then highlights different R data types, explaining their basic operations. You will focus on group-wise data manipulation with the split-apply-combine strategy, supported by specific examples. You will also learn to efficiently handle date, string, and factor variables along with different layouts of datasets using the reshape2 package. You will learn to use plyr effectively for data manipulation, truncating and rounding data, simulating data sets, as well as character manipulation.

    "description": "Going beyond performing simple analyses, researchers involved in the highly dynamic field of computational intelligent data analysis design algorithms that solve increasingly complex data problems in changing environments, including economic, environmental, and social data. Computational Intelligent Data Analysis for Sustainable Development presents novel methodologies for automatically processing these types of data to support rational decision making for sustainable development. Through numerous case studies and applications, it illustrates important data analysis methods, including mathematical optimization, machine learning, signal processing, and temporal and spatial analysis, for quantifying and describing sustainable development problems.\nWith a focus on integrated sustainability analysis, the book presents a large-scale quadratic programming algorithm to expand high-resolution input-output tables from the national scale to the multinational scale to measure the carbon footprint of the entire trade supply chain. It also quantifies the error or dispersion between different reclassification and aggregation schemas, revealing that aggregation errors have a high concentration over specific regions and sectors.\nThe book summarizes the latest contributions of the data analysis community to climate change research. A profuse amount of climate data of various types is available, providing a rich and fertile playground for future data mining and machine learning research. The book also pays special attention to several critical challenges in the science of climate extremes that are not handled by the current generation of climate models. It discusses potential conceptual and methodological directions to build a close integration between physical understanding, or physics-based modeling, and data-driven insights.\nThe book then covers the conservation of species and ecologically valuable land. A case study on the Pennsylvania Dirt and Gravel Roads Program demonstrates that multiple-objective linear programming is a more versatile and efficient approach than the widely used benefit targeting selection process.\nMoving on to renewable energy and the need for smart grids, the book explores how the ongoing transformation to a sustainable energy system of renewable sources leads to a paradigm shift from demand-driven generation to generation-driven demand. It shows how to maximize renewable energy as electricity by building a supergrid or mixing renewable sources with demand management and storage. It also presents intelligent data analysis for real-time detection of disruptive events from power system frequency data collected using an existing Internet-based frequency monitoring network as well as evaluates a set of computationally intelligent techniques for long-term wind resource assessment.\nIn addition, the book gives an example of how temporal and spatial data analysis tools are used to gather knowledge about behavioral data and address important social problems such as criminal offenses. It also applies constraint logic programming to a planning problem: the environmental and social impact assessment of the regional energy plan of the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.\nSustainable development problems, such as global warming, resource shortages, global species loss, and pollution, push researchers to create powerful data analysis approaches that analysts can then use to gain insight into these issues to support rational decision making. This volume shows both the data analysis and sustainable development communities how to use intelligent data analysis tools to address practical problems and encourages researchers to develop better methods.",

It is also the first book with a complete examination of how to enforce dynamic read and write access authorizations on released data, applicable to the emerging data outsourcing and cloud computing situations. Private companies, public organizations and final users are releasing, sharing, and disseminating their data to take reciprocal advantage of the great benefits of making their data available to others. This book weighs these benefits against the potential privacy risks. A detailed analysis of recent techniques for privacy protection in data release and case studies illustrate crucial scenarios. Protecting Privacy in Data Release targets researchers, professionals and government employees working in security and privacy. Advanced-level students in computer science and electrical engineering will also find this book useful as a secondary text or reference.",

    "description": "An introduction to statistical data mining, Data Analysis and Data Mining is both textbook and professional resource. Assuming only a basic knowledge of statistical reasoning, it presents core concepts in data mining and exploratory statistical models to students and professional statisticians-both those working in communications and those working in a technological or scientific capacity-who have a limited knowledge of data mining.\nThis book presents key statistical concepts by way of case studies, giving readers the benefit of learning from real problems and real data. Aided by a diverse range of statistical methods and techniques, readers will move from simple problems to complex problems. Through these case studies, authors Adelchi Azzalini and Bruno Scarpa explain exactly how statistical methods work; rather than relying on thepush the buttonphilosophy, they demonstrate how to use statistical tools to find the best solution to any given problem.\nCase studies feature current topics highly relevant to data mining, such web page traffic; the segmentation of customers; selection of customers for direct mail commercial campaigns; fraud detection; and measurements of customer satisfaction. Appropriate for both advanced undergraduate and graduate students, this much-needed book will fill a gap between higher level books, which emphasize technical explanations, and lower level books, which assume no prior knowledge and do not explain the methodology behind the statistical operations.",

Many are surprised to find that problems with their databases are caused by poor design rather than by difficulties in using the database management software. Beginning Database Design, 2nd Edition helps you ask and answer important questions about your data so you can understand the problem you are trying to solve and create a pragmatic design capturing the essentials while leaving the door open for refinements and extension at a later stage. Solid database design principles and examples help demonstrate the consequences of simplifications and pragmatic decisions. The rationale is to try to keep a design simple, but allow room for development as situations change or resources permit.",

    "description": "Our world is being revolutionized by data-driven methods: access to large amounts of data has generated new insights and opened exciting new opportunities in commerce, science, and computing applications. Processing the enormous quantities of data necessary for these advances requires large clusters, making distributed computing paradigms more crucial than ever.\nMapReduce is a programming model for expressing distributed computations on massive datasets and an execution framework for large-scale data processing on clusters of commodity servers. The programming model provides an easy-to-understand abstraction for designing scalable algorithms, while the execution framework transparently handles many system-level details, ranging from scheduling to synchronization to fault tolerance.\nThis book focuses on MapReduce algorithm design, with an emphasis on text processing algorithms common in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. We introduce the notion of MapReduce design patterns, which represent general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems across a variety of problem domains. This book not only intends to help the readerthink in MapReduce , but also discusses limitations of the programming model as well.",

While petabytes of unstructured data can be stored in Hadoop taking hours to be queried, terabytes of structured data can be stored in SQL Server 2012 and queried in seconds. This leads to the need to transfer and integrate data between Hadoop and SQL Server.",

Author David Coffin shows how to develop code to encrypt data in transit and at rest, to accomplish single sign-on with Oracle proxy connections, to generate and distribute two-factor authentication tokens from the Oracle server using pagers, cell phones (SMS), and e-mail, and to securely store and distribute Oracle application passwords.\nEarly chapters lay the foundation for effective security in an Oracle/Java environment. Each of the later chapters brings example code to a point where it may be applied as-is to address application security issues. Templates for applications are also provided to help you bring colleagues up to the same secure application standards. If you are less familiar with either Java or Oracle PL/SQL, you will not be left behind; all the concepts in this book are introduced as to a novice and addressed as to an expert.",
