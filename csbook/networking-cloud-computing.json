It describes the iteration principle by which the DNS translates names to IP addresses. It presents a configuration of a resolver both for UNIX and for Windows. The end of the chapter explains name server principles and describes various name server types.<br />\nChapter 2 is fully focused on the most basic DNS procedure, the DNS query. Through this procedure, the DNS translates names to IP addresses. In the very beginning, however, this chapter describes in detail the Resource Record structure. At the end of this chapter, many practical examples of DNS exchanges are listed.<br />\nChapter 3 deals with other DNS procedures (DNS Extensions), i.e., DNS Update, DNS Notify, incremental zone transfer, negative caching, IPv6 Extensions, IPsec, and TSIG.<br />\nChapter 4 talks about the DNS implementation. It is derived from its historical evolution. From the historical point of view, the oldest DNS implementation that is still sometimes used is BIND version 4. This implementation is very simple so it is suitable to describe basic principles with it. Next, the new generations of BIND are discussed followed by the Windows 2000 implementation.<br />\nChapter 5 discusses the tools for debugging DNS such as nslookup, dnswalk, and dig, how to control a name server using the rndc program, and the common errors that might occur while configuring DNS.<br />\nChapter 6 deals with the creation of DNS domains (domain delegation) and with the procedure of domain registration.",

These are all part of administration tasks, hence network administration is one of the main tasks of Linux system administration. By knowing how to configure system network interfaces in a reliable and optimal manner, Linux administrators can deploy and configure several network services including file, web, mail, and servers while working in large enterprise environments.\nStarting with a simple Linux router that passes traffic between two private networks, you will see how to enable NAT on the router in order to allow Internet access from the network, and will also enable DHCP on the network to ease configuration of client systems. You will then move on to configuring your own DNS server on your local network using bind9 and tying it into your DHCP server to allow automatic configuration of local hostnames. You will then future enable your network by setting up IPv6 via tunnel providers.\nMoving on, we ll configure Samba to centralize authentication for your network services; we will also configure Linux client to leverage it for authentication, and set up a RADIUS server that uses the directory server for authentication.\nToward the end, you will have a network with a number of services running on it, and will implement monitoring in order to detect problems as they occur.\nWhat you will learnRoute an IPv6 netblock to your local network\nModify your named instance to support setting hostnames for your IPv6 addresses\nUse SSH for remote console access\nConfigure NGINX with TLS\nSecure XMPP with TLS\nLeverage iptables6 to firewall your IPv6 traffic\nConfigure Samba as an Active Directory compatible directory service",

In this book, developers learn by playing and see how the libraries work in the real world.\nAs experience with Ajax increases, developers want the standard Ajax capabilities they repeatedly use to be preprogrammed for them and that s exactly what Ajax libraries do for them. They reduce the pain of handling cross-browser inconsistencies, they add useful language features, and provide sophisticated functionality. Of these, Prototype is the most popular JavaScript and Ajax framework for low-level user interface features such as animation, drag and drop, and pre-built widgets. Together, they free the developer up to concentrate on building the application. They make a rich user experience easy to achieve.\nThis book guides the reader through the Prototype and Scriptaculous libraries feature-by-feature. In just 350 pages, readers will find over 100 small working examples to help them explore the libraries. As well, they will develop a web-based image gallery that teacher them how to use Prototype and Scriptaculous in the real-world.\nPurchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.",

We will then build the same react component with JSX syntax to demystify its usage. You will see how to configure the Facebook Graph API, get your likes list, and render it using React.\nFollowing this, we will break the UI into components and you ll learn how to establish communication between them and respond to users input/events in order to have the UI reflect their state. You ll also get to grips with the ES6 syntaxes.\nMoving ahead, we will delve into the FLUX and its architecture, which is used to build client-side web applications and complements React s composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow. Towards the end, you ll find out how to make your components reusable, and test and deploy them into a production environment. Finally, we ll briefly touch on other topics such as React on the server side, Redux and some advanced concepts.",

    "description": "See how privileges, passwords, vulnerabilities, and exploits can be combined as an attack vector and breach any organization. Cyber attacks continue to increase in volume and sophistication. It is not a matter of if, but when, your organization will be breached. Attackers target the perimeter network, but, in recent years, have refocused their efforts on the path of least resistance: users and their privileges.\nIn decades past, an entire enterprise might be sufficiently managed through just a handful of credentials. Today\u2019s environmental complexity means privileged credentials are needed for a multitude of different account types (from domain admin and sysadmin to workstations with admin rights), operating systems (Windows, Unix, Linux, etc.), directory services, databases, applications, cloud instances, networking hardware, Internet of Things (IoT), social media, and more. When unmanaged, these privileged credentials pose a significant threat from external hackers and insider threats.There is no one silver bullet to provide the protection you need against all vectors and stages of an attack. And while some new and innovative solutions will help protect against or detect the initial infection, they are not guaranteed to stop 100% of malicious activity. The volume and frequency of privilege-based attacks continues to increase and test the limits of existing security controls and solution implementations.\nPrivileged Attack Vectors details the risks associated with poor privilege management, the techniques that hackers and insiders leverage, and the defensive measures that organizations must adopt to protect against a breach, protect against lateral movement, and improve the ability to detect hacker activity or insider threats in order to mitigate the impact.\nWhat You\u2019ll Learn\nKnow how identities, credentials, passwords, and exploits can be leveraged to escalate privileges during an attack<br />\nImplement defensive and auditing strategies to mitigate the threats and risk<br />\nUnderstand a 12-step privileged access management Implementation plan<br />\nConsider deployment and scope, including risk, auditing, regulations, and oversight solutions",

Listen as engineers and other leaders in the field discuss different ways of implementing SRE and SRE principles in a wide variety of settings; how SRE relates to other approaches like DevOps; the specialities on the cutting edge that will soon be common place in SRE; best practices and technologies that make practicing SRE easier; and finally hear what people have to say about the important, but rarely discussed human side of SRE.\nDavid N.

    "description": "This book presents link-layer cooperative frameworks to improve transmission reliability and network throughput of distributed TDMA MAC protocols in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The main objective of this book is to present link-layer node cooperation schemes to enhance the link-layer performance of vehicular networks, in terms of reliability and system throughput. The authors present approaches proposed for the medium access control (MAC) and node cooperation in VANETs. The authors also cover cooperative ADHOC MAC for point-to-point communication between a pair of source and destination nodes, and cooperative relay broadcasting for broadcast services in this book. The performance of node cooperation frameworks is evaluated via mathematical analysis and computer simulations, in comparison with distributed TDMA MAC protocols without cooperation. The proposed node cooperation frameworks enhance the performance of distributed TDMA MAC and make it more robust to tackle the dynamic networking conditions in VANETs. Furthermore, with cooperation enabled transmission, the performance of distributed TMDA MAC is more suitable to support the wide range of mobile applications and their strict service requirements which is discussed in this book.\nThe proposed node cooperation schemes and distributed cooperation decisions can be extended to wireless systems other than distributed TDMA MAC, such as cellular communication, for vehicular communications introduced in this book. This book is useful for researchers from academia and industry, as well as advanced level students interested in vehicular communication networks.It is also useful for professionals and engineers developing applications that use cooperative wireless communication systems.",

People have incredible strengths and incredible weaknesses, and as a Information Security professional, you need to recognize and devise training strategies that take advantage of both. This concise book introduces two such strategies, which combined, can take a security awareness program to the next level of effectiveness, retention, compliance, and maturity.Security policies and procedures are often times inconvenient, technically complex, and hard to understand.\u00a0Advanced Persistent Training\u00a0provides numerous tips from a wide range of disciplines to handle these especially difficult situations.Many information security professionals are required by regulation or policy to provide security awareness training within the companies they work for, but many believe that the resulting low compliance with training does not outweigh the costs of delivering that training. There are also many who believe that this training is crucial, if only it could be more effective.What you will learn:Present awareness materials all year-round in a way that people will really listen.\nImplement abehavior-firstapproach to teaching security awareness.\nAdopt to gamification the right way, even for people who hate games.\nUse tips from security awareness leaders addressing the same problems you face.Who is this book forSecurity awareness professionals or IT Security professionals who are tasked with teaching security awareness within their organization.",

Database as a Service (DBaaS) enables the delivery of more agile database services at lower costs. Some other benefits of DBaaS are secure database deployments and compliance to standards and best practices. Trove is a DBaaS built on OpenStack and is becoming more popular by the day.\nSince Trove is one of the most recent projects of OpenStack, DBAs and system administrators can find it difficult to set up and run a DBaaS using OpenStack Trove. This book helps DBAs make that step. We start by introducing you to the concepts of DBaaS and how is it implemented using OpenStack Trove. Following this, we look at implementing OpenStack and deploying Trove. Moving on, you will learn to create guest images to be used with Trove.

There are a large range of other applications under development or being proposed. Thederlying architectures share features such as decentralizaton, sharing of end system resources, autonomy, virtualization, and self-organization. These features constitute the P2P paradigm. This handbook broadly addresses a large cross-section of c- rent research and state-of-the-art reports on the nature of this paradigm from a large number of experts in the ?eld. Several trends in information and network technology such as increased perf- mance and deployment of broadband networking, wireless networking, and mobile devices are synergistic with and reinforcing the capabilities of the P2P paradigm. There is general expectation in the technical community that P2P networking will continue to be an important tool for networked applications and impact the evo- tion of the Internet. A large amount of research activity has resulted in a relatively short time, and a growing community of researchers has developed. The Handbook of Peer-to-Peer Networking is dedicated to discussions on P2P networks and their applications. This is a comprehensive book on P2P computing.",

The authors introduce a new coexistence and sharing scheme for multi-hop networks, describe the space-time sharing concept, introduce LTE-U, and examine sharing in broadcast and unicast environments. They then talk about different cooperation strategies to achieve mutual benefits for primary users (PU) and secondary users (SU), discuss protocols in a spectrum sharing context, and provide different game theory models between PUs and SUs.\nThe third section explains how to model the interactions of PUs and SUs, using an efficient calculation method to determine spectrum availability. Additionally, this section explains how to use scheduling models to achieve efficient SU traffic delivery. The subject of the fourth section is MIMO-oriented design. It focuses on how directional antennas and MIMO antennas greatly enhance wireless network performance. The authors include a few chapters on capacity/rate calculations as well as beamforming issues under MIMO antennas.\nPower control is covered in the fifth section which also describes the interference-aware power allocation schemes among cognitive radio users and the power control schemes in cognitive radios. The sixth section provides a comprehensive look at security issues, including different types of spectrum sharing attacks and threats as well as corresponding countermeasure schemes. The seventh and final section covers issues pertaining to military applications and examines how the military task protects its data flows when sharing the spectrum with civilian applications.",

    "description": "The annoyance factor for individual users whose email is crammed with pitches for pornography, absurd moneymaking schemes, and dubious health products is fierce. But for organizations, the cost of spam in lost productivity and burned bandwidth is astronomical. While society is grappling with a solution to the burgeoning crisis of spam proliferation, the pressure is on system administrators to find a solution to this massive problem in-house. And fast.Sys admins can field scores of complaints and spend months testing software suites that turn out to be too aggressive, too passive, or too complicated to setup only to discover that SpamAssassin (SA), the leading open source spam-fighting tool, is free, flexible, powerful, highly-regarded, and remarkably effective. The drawback? SpamAssassin s lack of published documentation.SpamAssassin by Alan Schwartz, is the only published resource devoted to SpamAssassin and how to integrate it effectively into your networks. This clear, concise guide clarifies the installation, configuration, and use of the SpamAssassin spam-checking system (versions 2.63 and 3.0) for Unix system administrators using the Postfix, Sendmail, Exim, or qmail mail servers, helping administrators make the right integration decision for their particular environments.It covers concrete advice on how to:Customize SpamAssassin s rules, and even create new ones Train SpamAssassin s Bayesian classifier, a statistical engine for detecting spam, to optimize it for the sort of email that you typically receive\nBlock specific addresses, hosts, and domains using third-party blacklists like the one maintained by Spamcop.net.\nWhitelist known good sources of email, so that messages from clients, coworkers, and friends aren t inadvertently lost.\nConfigure SpamAssassin to work with newer spam-filtering methods such as Hashcash (www.hashcash.org) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF).Sys admins, network administrators, and ISPs pay for spam with hours of experimentation and tedious junk email management, frayed user tempers, and their sanity. SpamAssassin, together with this essential book, give you the tools you need to take back your organization s inboxes.

As there has been high demand for the downlink (DL) simulator, it constitutes the central focus of the majority of the chapters. This part of the book reports on relevant highlights, including single-user (SU), multi-user (MU) and single-input-single-output (SISO) as well as multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions. Furthermore, it summarizes the optimal pilot pattern for high-speed communications as well as different synchronization issues. One chapter is devoted to experiments that show how the link level simulator can provide input to a testbed. This section also uses measurements to present and validate fundamental results on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions that are not limited to LTE-A. One chapter exclusively deals with the newest tool, the uplink (UL) link level simulator, and presents cutting-edge results.\nIn turn, Part Two focuses on system-level simulations. From early on, system-level simulations have been in high demand, as people are naturally seeking answers when scenarios with numerous base stations and hundreds of users are investigated. This part not only explains how mathematical abstraction can be employed to speed up simulations by several hundred times without sacrificing precision, but also illustrates new theories on how to abstract large urban heterogeneous networks with indoor small cells. It also reports on advanced applications such as train and car transmissions to demonstrate the tools\u2019 capabilities.\n&nbsp;",

The number of available Internet addresses is now nearly exhausted, due mostly to the explosion of commercial websites and entries from an expanding number of countries. This growing shortage has effectively put the Internet community and some of its most brilliant engineers on alert for the last decade.Their solution was to create IPv6, a new Internet standard which will ultimately replace the current and antiquated IPv4. As the new backbone of the Internet, this new protocol would fix the most difficult problems that the Internet faces today scalability and management. And even though IPv6 s implementation has met with some resistance over the past few years, all signs are now pointing to its gradual worldwide adoption in the very near future. Sooner or later, all network administrators will need to understand IPv6, and now is a good time to get started.IPv6 Network Administration offers administrators the complete inside info on IPv6. This book reveals the many benefits as well as the potential downsides of this next-generation protocol. It also shows readers exactly how to set up and administer an IPv6 network.A must-have for network administrators everywhere, IPv6 Network Administration delivers an even-handed approach to what will be the most fundamental change to the Internet since its inception. Some of the other IPv6 assets that are covered include:routing\nintegrated auto-configuration\nquality-of-services (QoS)\nenhanced mobility\nend-to-end securityIPv6 Network Administration explains what works, what doesn t, and most of all, what s practical when considering upgrading networks from the current protocol to IPv6.",

    "description": "This book provides a template with step-by-step instructions on how to respond and recover when hackers get into your SCADA system and cause building equipment to act erratically or fail completely. When hackers shut off the water, turn off the building power, disable the sewage effluent pumps and activate the fire alarm, you have to do something quick. It is even more alarming that hackers can do all those things at the same time\u2015even from the other side of the planet.\nNot every equipment failure or power outage is a cyber-physical attack. When your building is attacked, you probably won\u2019t suspect it was a hacker\u2015until you see a pattern. The building control system (BCS) will actsquirrellyand you will know\u2015it really is a cyber-physical attack.\nOnce a cyber-physical attack occurs, it can mean years of court cases, job losses, higher insurance rates, and maybe even criminal litigation. It also takes years to overcome the loss of safety credibility to your employees and the local community.\u00a0Cyber-Physical Attack Recovery Procedures\u00a0provides a detailed guide to taking the right steps ahead of time, and equipping your facility and employees with the training, knowledge, and tools they need and may save lives.\nThe book contains:A one-of-a-kind action plan describing how hackers attack building equipment, the extent of damage possible, and how to respond when a cyber-physical attack occurs.\nDetailed descriptions of cyber-physical attacks directed against SCADA systems or building controls, as well as cyber booby traps\nInvaluable appendices, including: Emergency Procedures, Team Staffing and Tasking, Alternate Site Procedures, a Documentation List, Software and Hardware Inventories, Vendor Contact Lists, External Support Agreements, and much more.",

Whether your customer is another department within your own company or an external client, this book provides you with tested processes and tools to help you understand traffic flow, protocol behavior, and internetworking technologies. After completing this book, you will be equipped to design enterprise networks that meet a customer\u2019s requirements for functionality, capacity, performance, availability, scalability, affordability, security, and manageability.\nAudience\nThis book is for you if you are an internetworking professional responsible for designing and maintaining medium- to large-sized enterprise networks. If you are a network engineer, architect, or technician who has a working knowledge of network protocols and technologies, this book will provide you with practical advice on applying your knowledge to internetwork design.\nThis book also includes useful information for consultants, systems engineers, and sales engineers who design corporate networks for clients. In the fast-paced presales environment of many systems engineers, it often is difficult to slow down and insist on a top-down, structured systems analysis approach. Wherever possible, this book includes shortcuts and assumptions that can be made to speed up the network design process.\nFinally, this book is useful for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and information technology disciplines. Students who have taken one or two courses in networking theory will find Top-Down Network Design, Third Edition, an approachable introduction to the engineering and business issues related to developing real-world networks that solve typical business problems.\nChanges for the Third Edition\nNetworks have changed in many ways since the second edition was published. Many legacy technologies have disappeared and are no longer covered in the book. In addition, modern networks have become multifaceted, providing support for numerous bandwidth-hungry applications and a variety of devices, ranging from smart phones to tablet PCs to high-end servers. Modern users expect the network to be available all the time, from any device, and to let them securely collaborate with coworkers, friends, and family. Networks today support voice, video, high-definition TV, desktop sharing, virtual meetings, online training, virtual reality, and applications that we can\u2019t even imagine that brilliant college students are busily creating in their dorm rooms.\nAs applications rapidly change and put more demand on networks, the need to teach a systematic approach to network design is even more important than ever. With that need in mind, the third edition has been retooled to make it an ideal textbook for college students. The third edition features review questions and design scenarios at the end of each chapter to help students learn top-down network design.",

So we decided to follow suit. This book isn t just a mild reworking of the previous edition to make it run with the new Rails. Instead, it s a complete refactoring.\nYou ll still find the Depot example at the front, but you ll also find testing knitted right in. Gone are the long reference chapters that s what the web does best. Instead you ll find more targeted information on all the aspects of Rails that you ll need to be a successful Web developer.\nNow Updated for Rails 3.2\nRails 3.1 and Rails 3.2 introduce many user-facing changes, and this release has been updated to match all the latest changes and new best practices in Rails 3.1 and Rails 3.2. This includes full support for Ruby 1.9.2 hash syntax; incorporation of the new Sprockets 2.0 Asset Pipeline, including SCSS and CoffeeScript; jQuery now being the default; reversible migrations; JSON response support; Rack::Cache, and much more.\nRuby on Rails helps you produce high-quality, beautiful-looking web applications quickly. You concentrate on creating the application, and Rails takes care of the details.\nTens of thousands of developers have used this award-winning book to learn Rails. It s a broad, far-reaching tutorial and reference that s recommended by the Rails core team. If you re new to Rails, you ll get step-by-step guidance. If you re an experienced developer, this book will give you the comprehensive, insider information you need.\nRails has evolved over the years, and this book has evolved along with it. We still start with a step-by-step walkthrough of building a real application, and in-depth chapters look at the built-in Rails features. This edition now gives new Ruby and Rails users more information on the Ruby language and takes more time to explain key concepts throughout. Best practices on how to apply Rails continue to change, and this edition keeps up. Examples use cookie backed sessions, HTTP authentication, and Active Record-based forms, and the book focuses throughout on the right way to use Rails.

    "description": "Imagine a set of simple principles that could help you to understand how parts combine to become a whole, and how each part sees the whole from its own perspective. If such principles were any good, it shouldn\u2019t matter whether we\u2019re talking about humans on a team, birds in a flock, computers in a datacenter, or cogs in a Swiss watch. A theory of cooperation ought to be pretty universal, so we should be able to apply it both to technology and to the workplace.\nSuch principles are the subject of Promise Theory, and the focus of this insightful book. The goal of Promise Theory is to reveal the behavior of a whole from the sum of its parts, taking the viewpoint of the parts rather than the whole. In other words, it is a bottom-up, constructionist view of the world. Start <i>Thinking in Promises</i> and find out why this discipline works for documenting system behaviors from the bottom-up.",

Directives serve as the core building blocks in AngularJS and enable you to create reusable models that mold around your data structures and breathe new life into the intersection of HTML and JavaScript.\nAngularJS Directives serves as an in-depth study of some of the core features of AngularJS and provides you with all the knowledge you need to create fully dynamic web applications that respond in real-time to changes in data. You ll learn how to build directives from the ground up as well as some of the best practices for architecting them. By the end of this book, you ll be able to create a web application comprised of multiple modules all working together seamlessly to provide the best possible user experience.\nAngularJS Directives starts by investigating the best practices for single-page application development overall before diving into how AngularJS directives fulfill those goals. At each step, you ll learn both the how and why of what we re building, and by the end, you ll not only know the facts necessary to create a directive, but you\u2019ll also have the knowledge to decide how best to assemble it.\nYou ll also learn why it s best to build applications with the data-model as your foundation, how to craft new dynamic modules that communicate with each other, how to build widgets that can be embedded in third-party websites, and even how to create custom inputs so your users can intuitively interact with your data. In AngularJS Directives, you ll learn all the necessary tools to begin architecting your own directives and how to use them in the construction of a more dynamic Web.\n<b>What you will learn from this book</b>Craft a dynamic module that reflects data changes in real-time\nCreate an interconnected single-page application\nBuild third-party widgets\nConsume existing content and integrate it into your directive\nIntegrate AngularJS with jQuery plugins\nCommunicate with other modules via messaging\nUnit test your AngularJS directive\nSet up and execute browser functionality tests with the Angular Scenario Runner",

    "description": "This book includes a study of trustworthiness, percentile response time, service availability, and authentication in the networks between users and cloud service providers, and at service stations or sites that may be owned by different service providers. The first part of the book contains an analysis of percentile response time, which is one of the most important SLA (service level agreements) metrics. Effective and accurate numerical solutions for the calculation of the percentile response time in single-class and multi-class queueing networks are obtained. Then, the numerical solution is incorporated in a resource allocation problem. Specifically, the authors present an approach for the resource optimization that minimizes the total cost of computer resources required while preserving a given percentile of the response time. In the second part, the approach is extended to consider trustworthiness, service availability, and the percentile of response time in Web services. These QoS metrics are clearly defined and their quantitative analysis provided. The authors then take into account these QoS metrics in a trust-based resource allocation problem in which a set of cloud computing resources is used by a service provider to host a typical Web services application for single-class customer services and multipleclass customer services respectively. Finally, in the third part of the book a thorough performance evaluation of two notable public key cryptography-based authentication techniques; Public-Key Cross Realm Authentication in Kerberos (PKCROSS) and Public Key Utilizing Tickets for Application Servers (PKTAPP, a.k.a. KX.509/KCA); is given, in terms of computational and communication times. The authors then demonstrate their performance difference using queuing networks. PKTAPP has been proposed to address the scalability issue of PKCROSS. However, their in-depth analysis of these two techniques shows that PKTAPP does not perform better than PKCROSS in a large-scale system. Thus, they propose a new public key cryptography-based group authentication technique. The performance analysis demonstrates that the new technique can scale better than PKCORSS and PKTAPP.",

Zabbix 2.2 allows you to customize and implement ideas by extending, adding, or customizing functionality, giving an added value to that technology.\nThis comprehensive guide will help you to make both strategic and practical decisions about the Zabbix monitoring system, so that it will fit your environment and monitoring needs like a glove. From choosing the correct size and configurationto what you should actually monitor, including exporting and integrating your data with other systems, this book will leave you with no doubts about the crucial role of a well configured monitoring system.\nIntroducing you to methods to configure and choose between high availability and distributed Zabbix architectures for your largeenvironment, this guide will proceed to show you how to gather monitoring data, visualize, and act on it. Next, the guide explores how you can extend Zabbix and connect it to trouble ticketing systems or data mining solutions. You will also learn how to choose the ideal database backend, monitor appliances that only talk SNMP and application servers that talk JMX, and organize your charts and maps in screens that can be visualized on big screens. It shows you how to leverage Zabbix s discovery capabilities to track your ever changing environment and build complex, intelligent alarms that won t distract you with trivial problems. Finally, you will learn to expand Zabbix s capabilities through its scripting facilities, protocol and powerful API.",

Couchbase also introduces smart client API for various programming language to integrate the database with the application easily, yet providing very complex features like cluster health awareness.\nThis book achieves its goal by taking up an end-to-end development structure, right from understanding NOSQL document design to implementing full fledged eCommerce application design using Couchbase as a backend.\nStarting with the architecture of Couchbase to get you up and running, this book quickly takes you through designing a NoSQL document and implementing highly scalable applications using Java API. You will then be introduced to document design and get to know the various ways to administer Couchbase. Followed by this, learn to store documents using bucket. Moving on, you will then learn to store, retrieve and delete documents using smart client base on Java API. You will then retrieve documents using SQL like syntax call N1QL. Next, you will learn how to write map reduce base views. Finally, you will configure XDCR for disaster recovery and implement an eCommerce application using Couchbase.",

Surprisingly though, a large number of users even highly experienced users exhibit poor file management skills, resulting in frustration and lost data. This brief but invaluable book, File Management Made Simple can resolve this by providing you with the skills and best practices needed for creating, managing and protecting your data.\nDo any of the following scenarios sound familiar to you? You\u2019ve downloaded an attachment from your e-mail, but aren\u2019t sure where you downloaded it to. You spent an entire evening working on a document only to discover the next morning that you didn\u2019t save it to your flash drive like you thought you had? Maybe you had a guest visiting and wanted to share with them the pictures you took of your kids recital, yet when you went to get them you were unable to recall where you stored them on your PC. Or you scanned your receipts for your expense reports on day and came back the next day and scanned some for another report only to find that the new ones numbered Scan 1, Scan 2,still exist. Unfortunately, for a vast number of PC users, scenarios like these are all too common. These situations are not only extremely frustrating for the user, but also tend to discourage them from ever wanting to touch a PC again!\nWhy is that? What is the common factor? It\u2019s simple really. Each of these issues can be attributed to poor file management skills. In my experience, the people with the worst file management skills are simply the ones that lack an understanding of how to navigate the Windows operating system. However this situation can be easily rectified. And once you can successfully navigate your computer s drive and folder structure, you ll be hard pressed to misplace anything.\nAlthough this process can seem daunting to the uninitiated, this isn\u2019t black magic. In fact, it\u2019s actually quite simpl\ne. Keeping your files and folders organized on the computer is no more difficult than keeping them organized in real life. There is a place for everything and everything has its place. We will show you how to navigate Windows correctly and efficiently. Where specific types of files should be stored. We\u2019ll also show you how best to name and manage your files; such as using descriptive folders to identify files, implementing the best naming conventions for files and directories, and how to group various types of data together; ensuring that the data you need is always readily available. Finally we\u2019ll introduce you to some of the best options for transporting and protecting your data. We will show you the skills you need to easily manage your data, using clear and simple English, without the confusing technical jargon. All this and more can be accomplished with File Management Made Simple by your side.",

The main purpose of Amazon EC2 is to make web-scale cloud computing easier for the developers. It offers developers and companies the raw building blocks like load balancers, object stores and virtual machines running on general hardware (that is, Amazon runs a multitude of hardware components but presents them as a generic utility to its users) with accessible APIs in order to create scalable software products\nThis book covers designing, developing, and deploying scalable, highly available, and secure applications on the AWS platform. By following the steps in the recipes, you will be able to effectively and systematically resolve issues related to development, deployment, and infrastructure for enterprise-grade cloud applications or products.\nThis book starts with helping you choose and configure the right EC2 instances to meet your application-specific requirements. The book then moves on to creating a CloudFormation template and will teach you how to work with stacks. You will then be introduced to using IAM services to configure users, groups, roles, and multi-factor authentication. You will also learn how to connect AD to AWS IAM. Next, you will be using AWS data services and accessing other AWS services including Route 53, Amazon S3, and AWS SES (Amazon Simple Email Service). Finally, you will be deploying AWS applications using Docker containers.",

As a result they may have little awareness that they are critically dependent on the embedded security devices that are becoming pervasive in daily modern life. <i>Secure Smart Embedded Devices, Platforms and Applications</i> provides a broad overview of the many security and practical issues of embedded devices, tokens, and their operation systems, platforms and main applications. It also addresses a diverse range of industry/government initiatives and considerations, while focusing strongly on technical and practical security issues.\nThe benefits and pitfalls of developing and deploying applications that rely on embedded systems and their security functionality are presented. A sufficient level of technical detail to support embedded systems is provided throughout the text, although the book is quite readable for those seeking awareness through an initial overview of the topics. This edited volume benefits from the contributions of industry and academic experts and helps provide a cross-discipline overview of the security and practical issues for embedded systems, tokens, and platforms. It is an ideal complement to the earlier work, <i>Smart Cards Tokens, Security and Applications</i> from the same editors.",

It explains the Mobile Healthcare Network (MHN) architecture and its diverse applications, and reviews the existing works on security and privacy for MHNs. Critical future challenges and research problems are also identified.\nUsing a Quality-of-Protection perspective, the authors provide valuable insights on security and privacy preservation for MHNs. Some promising solutions are proposed to accommodate the issues of secure health data transmission, misbehavior detection, health data processing with privacy preservation and access control in MHNs. Specifically, the secure health data aggregation explores social spots to help forward health data and enable users to select the optimal relay according to their social ties and health data priority. The secure aggregation achieves the desirable delivery ratio with reasonable communication costs and lower delay for the data in different priorities.\nA proposed misbehavior detection scheme distinguishes Sybil attackers from normal users by comparing their mobile contacts and pseudonym changing behaviors. The detection accuracy is high enough to resist various Sybil attacks including forgery. In addition, the health data processing scheme can analyze the encrypted health data and preserve user\u2019s privacy at the same time. Attribute based access control can achieve fine-grained acces\ns control with user-defined access policy in MHNs.<br />\nSecurity and Privacy for Mobile Healthcare Networks is designed for researchers and advanced-level students interested in healthcare security and secure data transmission.",

The networks considered range from vehicular networks to electric power networks to data networks.\nThe main point of view taken is that of mathematical programming in concert with finite-dimensional variational inequality theory. The principle modeling perspectives are network optimization, the theory of Nash games, and mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints. Computational methods and novel mathematical formulations are emphasized. Among the numerical methods explored are network simplex, gradient projection, fixed-point, gap function, Lagrangian relaxation, Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, simplicial decomposition, and computational intelligence algorithms.\nMany solved example problems are included that range from simple to quite challenging. Theoretical analyses of several models and algorithms, to uncover existence, uniqueness and convergence properties, are undertaken. The book is meant for use in advanced undergraduate as well as doctoral courses taught in civil engineering, industrial engineering, systems engineering, and operations research degree programs. At the same time, the book should be a useful resource for industrial and university researchers engaged in the mathematical modeling and numerical analyses of infrastructure networks.",

Main problems concern 1) the placement of virtual resources for opening a new network on the fly, and 2) the urbanisation of virtual resource implemented on physical network equipment. This architecture deals with mechanisms capable of controlling automatically the placement of all virtual resources within the physical network.\nIn this book, we describe how to create and delete virtual networks on the fly. Indeed, the system is able to create any new network with any kind of resource (e.g., virtual switch, virtual routers, virtual LSRs, virtual optical path, virtual firewall, virtual SIP-based servers, virtual devices, virtual servers, virtual access points, and so on). We will show how this architecture is compatible with new advances in SDN (Software Defined Networking), new high-speed transport protocol like TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) and LISP (Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol), NGN, IMS, Wi-Fi new generation, and 4G/5G networks. Finally, we introduce the Cloud of security and the virtualisation of secure elements (smartcard) that should definitely transform how to secure the Internet.",

Cloud Computing represents a major change to the IT services landscape, but it also introduces a different set of potential security risks, which need to be understood and addressed. Securing Cloud ServicesA pragmatic approach to security architecture in the Cloud goes beyond the subject of generic Cloud security and, instead, offers a more detailed, architectural approach to securing Cloud services. It describes how security architecture processes may be used to derive a set of security controls to manage the risks associated with working in the Cloud. It uses a conceptual security reference model (SRM) to define a set of common security services, and then explains how these services can be delivered across the various Cloud service models in order to secure a Cloud-based service. Lee Newcombe is an enterprise architect with commercial experience gained at numerous high-profile companies, including a retail bank, a systems integrator and one of the Big 4 consultancies. He has worked within various Cloud programmes and acted as the IT industry security expert during the early days of the UK Government s G-Cloud programme. Lee has been writing about, presenting on, and working with Cloud technologies since 2007, and is a named contributor to the Cloud Security Alliance guidance document.",

    "description": "There are many books on computers, networks, and software engineering but none that integrate the three with applications. Integration is important because, increasingly, software dominates the performance, reliability, maintainability, and availability of complex computer and systems. Books on software engineering typically portray software as if it exists in a vacuum with no relationship to the wider system. This is wrong because a system is more than software. It is comprised of people, organizations, processes, hardware, and software. All of these components must be considered in an integrative fashion when designing systems. On the other hand, books on computers and networks do not demonstrate a deep understanding of the intricacies of developing software. In this book you will learn, for example, how to quantitatively analyze the performance, reliability, maintainability, and availability of computers, networks, and software in relation to the total system. Furthermore, you will learn how to evaluate and mitigate the risk of deploying integrated systems. You will learn how to apply many models dealing with the optimization of systems. Numerous quantitative examples are provided to help you understand and interpret model results. This book can be used as a first year graduate course in computer, network, and software engineering; as an on-the-job reference for computer, network, and software engineers; and as a reference for these disciplines.",

    "description": "This book sheds light on networked control systems; it describes different techniques for asynchronous control, moving away from the periodic actions of classical control, replacing them with state-based decisions and reducing the frequency with which communication between subsystems is required. The text focuses specially on event-based control.\nSplit into two parts, Asynchronous Control for Networked Systems begins by addressing the problems of single-loop networked control systems, laying out various solutions which include two alternative model-based control schemes (anticipatory and predictive) and the use of H2/H\u221e robust control to deal with network delays and packet losses. Results on self-triggering and send-on-delta sampling are presented to reduce the need for feedback in the loop. In Part II, the authors present solutions for distributed estimation and control. They deal first with reliable networks and then extend their results to scenarios in which delays and packet losses may occur.\nThe novel results presented in Asynchronous Control for Networked Systems are transmitted in a concise and clear style supported by simulation and experimental examples. Some applications are also provided.\nAcademic researchers and graduate students investigating control theory, control engineering and computer communications systems can use this monograph to learn how asynchronous control helps tackle the problems of networked systems in centralized and distributed schemes. Control practitioners at work in power systems, vehicle coordination and traffic networks will also find this book helpful in improving the performance of their systems",

The brokering, negotiation, management, monitoring and reconfiguration of cloud resources are challenging tasks for developers and users of cloud applications due to the different business models associated with resource consumption, and to the variety of services and features offered by different cloud providers.\nIn chapter 1 the concepts of cloud portability and interoperability are introduced, together with the issues and limitations arising when such features are lacking or ignored. Subsequently, chapter 2 provides an overview of the state-of-the-art methodologies and technologies that are currently used or being explored to enable cloud portability and interoperability. Chapter 3 illustrates the main cross-platform cloud APIs and how they can solve interoperability and portability issues. In turn, chapter 4 presents a set of ready-to-use solutions which, either because of their broad-scale use in cloud computing scenarios or because they utilize established or emerging standards, play a fundamental part in providing interoperable and portable solutions. Lastly, chapter 5 presents an overview of emerging standards for cloud Interoperability and portability.\nResearchers and developers of cloud-based services will find here a brief survey of the relevant methodologies, APIs and standards, illustrated by case studies and complemented by an extensive reference list for more detailed descriptions of every topic covered.",

There was previously a lack of a system-administration-free platform that allowed the scaling of Java EE applications, but WildFly 8 in combination with OpenShift fills that gap.\nThe book starts with an explanation of the installation of WildFly and application server configuration. Then, it moves on to the configuration of enterprise services and also explores the new web container Undertow. It then covers domain configuration, application deployment, and application server management. By the end of the book, you will have a firm grasp of all the important aspects of clustering, load balancing, and WildFly security. This guide is invaluable for anyone who works with or is planning to switch to WildFly.",

    "description": "A major limitation of conventional web sites is their unorganized and isolated contents, which is created mainly for human consumption. This limitation can be addressed by organizing and publishing data, using powerful formats that add structure and meaning to the content of web pages and link related data to one another. Computers canunderstandsuch data better, which can be useful for task automation. The web sites that provide semantics (meaning) to software agents form the Semantic Web, the Artificial Intelligence extension of the World Wide Web. In contrast to the conventional Web (theWeb of Documents ), the Semantic Web includes theWeb of Data , which connectsthings(representing real-world humans and objects) rather than documents meaningless to computers. Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web explains the practical aspects and the theory behind the Semantic Web and how structured data, such as HTML5 Microdata and JSON-LD, can be used to improve your site\u2019s performance on next-generation Search Engine Result Pages and be displayed on Google Knowledge Panels. You will learn how to represent arbitrary fields of human knowledge in a machine-interpretable form using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the cornerstone of the Semantic Web. You will see how to store and manipulate RDF data in purpose-built graph databases such as triplestores and quadstores, that are exploited in Internet marketing, social media, and data mining, in the form of Big Data applications such as the Google Knowledge Graph, Wikidata, or Facebook\u2019s Social Graph.\nWith the constantly increasing user expectations in web services and applications, Semantic Web standards gain more popularity. This book will familiarize you with the leading controlled vocabularies and ontologies and explain how to represent your own concepts. After learning the principles of Linked Data, the five-star deployment scheme, and the Open Data concept, you will be able to create and interlink five-star Linked Open Data, and merge your RDF graphs to the LOD Cloud. The book also covers the most important tools for generating, storing, extracting, and visualizing RDF data, including, but not limited to, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, TopBraid Composer, Sindice, Apache Marmotta, Callimachus, and Tabulator. You will learn to implement Apache Jena and Sesame in popular IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans, and use these APIs for rapid Semantic Web application development. Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web demonstrates how to represent and connect structured data to reach a wider audience, encourage data reuse, and provide content that can be automatically processed with full certainty. As a result, your web contents will be integral parts of the next revolution of the Web.",

The text is integrated with MATLAB-based programs to enhance the understanding of the subject\u2019s underlying theories. It includes current topics of increasing importance such as turbo codes, LDPC codes, LT codes, Raptor codes and space-time coding in detail, in addition to the traditional codes such as cyclic codes, BCH and RS codes and convolutional codes. MIMO communications is a multiple antenna technology, which is an effective method for high-speed or high-reliability wireless communications. PC-based MATLAB m-files for the illustrative examples are included and also provided on the accompanying CD, which will help students and researchers involved in advanced and current concepts in coding theory. Channel coding, the core of digital communication and data storage, has undergone a major revolution as a result of the rapid growth of mobile and wireless communications.\nThe book is divided into 11 chapters. Assuming no prior knowledge in the field of channel coding, the opening chapters (12) begin with basic theory and discuss how to improve the performance of wireless communication channels using channel coding. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce Galois fields and present detailed coverage of BCH codes and Reed-Solomon codes. Chapters 5\u20137 introduce the family of convolutional codes, hard and soft-decision Viterbi algorithms, turbo codes, BCJR algorithm for turbo decoding and studies trellis coded modulation (TCM), turbo trellis coded modulation (TTCM), bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) as well as iterative BICM (BICM-ID) and compares them under various channel conditions. Chapters 8 and 9 focus on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, LT codes and Raptor codes. Chapters 10 and 11 discuss MIMO systems and space-time (ST) coding.",

Introduction to Computer Networks and Cybersecurity takes an integrated approach to networking and cybersecurity, highlighting the interconnections so that you quickly understand the complex design issues in modern networks. This full-color book uses a wealth of examples and illustrations to effectively connect the principles of networks and networking protocols with the relevant cybersecurity issues.\nGet the Fundamentals of Internet Architecture and the Protocol Layers\nOrganized into six parts, the book walks you through the fundamentals, starting with the way most people first encounter computer networks\u2014through the Internet architecture. Part 1 covers the most important Internet applications and the methods used to develop them. Part 2 discusses the network edge, consisting of hosts, access networks, LANs, and the physical media used with the physical and link layers. Part 3 explores the network core, including packet/circuit switches, routers, and the Internet backbone, and Part 4 examines reliable transport and the management of network congestion.\nLearn about Malware and Security Systems\nBuilding on the concepts and principles, the book then delves into state-of-the-art cybersecurity mechanisms in Part 5. It reviews the types of malware and the various security systems, made up of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other components. Crucially, it provides a seamless view of an information infrastructure in which security capabilities are built in rather than treated as an add-on feature. The book closes with a look at emerging technologies, including virtualization and data center and cloud computing unified communication.\nUnderstand Cyber Attacks\u2014and What You Can Do to Defend against Them\nThis comprehensive text supplies a carefully designed introduction to both the fundamentals of networks and the latest advances in Internet security. Addressing cybersecurity from an Internet perspective, it prepares you to better understand the motivation and methods of cyber attacks and what you can do to protect the networks and the applications that run on them.\nPedagogical Features\nThe book\u2019s modular design offers exceptional flexibility, whether you want to use it for quick reference, self-study, or a wide variety of one- or two-semester courses in computer networks, cybersecurity, or a hybrid of both. Learning goals in each chapter show you what you can expect to learn, and end-of-chapter problems and questions test your understanding. Throughout, the book uses real-world examples and extensive illustrations and screen captures to explain complicated concepts simply and clearly. Ancillary materials, including PowerPoint\u00ae animations, are available to instructors with qualifying course adoption.",

It presents a sensitive detector, named Twins, which uses a pair of adjacent passive tags to detect uncooperative targets (such as intruders). Twins leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state that is caused by interference among passive tags. The author expands on the previous object tracking methods, which are mostly device-based, and reveals a new interference model and their extensive experiments for validation. A prototype implementation of the Twins-based intrusion detection scheme with commercial off-the-shelf reader and tags is also covered in this SpringerBrief. Device-Free Object Tracking Using Passive Tags is designed for researchers and professionals interested in smart sensing, localization, RFID and Internet of Things applications. The content is also useful for advanced-level students studying electrical engineering and computer science.",

    "description": "The present work is meant as a reference to provide an organic and comprehensive view of the most relevant results in the exciting new field of Networks of Networks (NetoNets). Seminal papers have recently been published posing the basis to study what happens when different networks interact, thus providing evidence for the emergence of new, unexpected behaviors and vulnerabilities. From those seminal works, the awareness on the importance understanding Networks of Networks (NetoNets) has spread to the entire community of Complexity Science. The reader will benefit from the experience of some of the most well-recognized leaders in this field. The contents have been aggregated under four headings; General Theory, Phenomenology, Applications and Risk Assessment. The reader will be impressed by the different applications of the general paradigm that span from physiology, to financial risk, to transports. We are currently making the first steps to reduce the distance between the language and the way of thinking of the two communities of experts in real infrastructures and the complexity scientists. Although this path may prove to be long, it is extremely promising, both in extending our understanding of complex systems and in finding concrete applications that can enhance the life quality of millions of people.",

    "description": "This brief presents a peer-to-peer (P2P) web-hosting infrastructure (named pWeb) that can transform networked, home-entertainment devices into lightweight collaborating Web servers for persistently storing and serving multimedia and web content. The issues addressed include ensuring content availability, Plexus routing and indexing, naming schemes, web ID, collaborative web search, network architecture and content indexing. In pWeb, user-generated voluminous multimedia content is proactively uploaded to a nearby network location (preferably within the same LAN or at least, within the same ISP) and a structured P2P mechanism ensures Internet accessibility by tracking the original content and its replicas. This new paradigm of information management strives to provide low or no-cost cloud storage and entices the end users to upload voluminous multimedia content to the cloud data centers. However, it leads to difficulties in privacy, network architecture and content availability. Concise and practical, this brief examines the benefits and pitfalls of the pWeb web-hosting infrastructure. It is designed for professionals and practitioners working on P2P and web management and is also a useful resource for advanced-level students studying networks or multimedia.",

Network analysis is the process of isolating these problems and fixing them, and Wireshark has long been the most popular network analyzer for achieving this goal. Based on hundreds of solved cases, Network Analysis using Wireshark Cookbook provides you with practical recipes for effective Wireshark network analysis to analyze and troubleshoot your network.Network analysis using Wireshark Cookbookhighlights the operations of Wireshark as a network analyzer tool. This book provides you with a set of practical recipes to help you solve any problems in your network using a step-by-step approach.Network analysis using Wireshark Cookbookstarts by discussing the capabilities of Wireshark, such as the statistical tools and the expert system, capture and display filters, and how to use them. The book then guides you through the details of the main networking protocols, that is, Ethernet, LAN switching, and TCP/IP, and then discusses the details of application protocols and their behavior over the network. Among the application protocols that are discussed in the book are standard Internet protocols like HTTP, mail protocols, FTP, and DNS, along with the behavior of databases, terminal server clients, Citrix, and other applications that are common in the IT environment.\nIn a bottom-up troubleshooting approach, the book goes up through the layers of the OSI reference model explaining how to resolve networking problems. The book starts from Ethernet and LAN switching, through IP, and then on to TCP/UDP with a focus on TCP performance problems. It also focuses on WLAN security. Then, we go through application behavior issues including HTTP, mail, DNS, and other common protocols. The book finishes with a look at network forensics and how to search and find security problems that might harm the network.",

Although the security for SAE/LTE evolved from the security for GSM and 3G, due to different architectural and business requirements of fourth generation systems the SAE/LTE security architecture is substantially different from its predecessors. This book presents in detail the security mechanisms employed to meet these requirements.\nWhilst the industry standards inform how to implement systems, they do not provide readers with the underlying principles behind security specifications.

The volume also offers an in-depth treatment of cutting-edge Cooperative Communications. This monograph collates the latest techniques in a number of specific design areas of turbo-detected MIMO-OFDM wireless systems. As a result a wide range of topical subjects are examined, including channel coding and multiuser detection (MUD), with a special emphasis on optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) MUDs, reduced-complexity genetic algorithm aided near-ML MUDs and sphere detection. The benefits of spreading codes as well as joint iterative channel and data estimation are only a few of the radical new features of the book. Also considered are the benefits of turbo and LDPC channel coding, the entire suite of known joint coding and modulation schemes, space-time coding as well as SDM/SDMA MIMOs within the context of various application examples.\nThe book systematically converts the lessons of Shannon s information theory into design principles applicable to practical wireless systems; the depth of discussions increases towards the end of the book. Discusses many state-of-the-art topics important to today s wireless communications engineers. Includes numerous complete system design examples for the industrial practitioner. Offers a detailed portrayal of sphere detection. Based on over twenty years of research into OFDM in the context of various applications, subsequently presenting comprehensive bibliographies.",

    "description": "Most large enterprises have switched to IP telephony, and service provider backbone networks have largely converted to VoIP transport. But there s a key missing link: most businesses still connect to their service providers via old-fashioned, inflexible TDM trunks. Now, three Cisco experts show how to use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking to eliminate legacy interconnects and gain the full benefits of end-to-end VoIP.\nWritten for enterprise decision-makers, network architects, consultants, and service providers, this book demystifies SIP trunking technology and trends and brings unprecedented clarity to the transition from TDM to SIP interconnects. The authors separate the true benefits of SIP trunking from the myths and help you systematically evaluate and compare service provider offerings. You will find detailed cost analyses, including guidance on identifying realistic, achievable savings.\nSIP Trunking also introduces essential techniques for optimizing network design and security, introduces proven best practices for implementation, and shows how to apply them through a start-to-finish case study.",

The standardization of SMS started in February 1985 as a part of the creation of the second generation digital cellular system GSM, and the 25th anniversary of the first work on SMS provides an opportunity to review and understand how this service was developed. The book also looks to the future, as a large number of new GSM and evolved GSM phones will support SMS as a mass market high availability messaging service, a new simple Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) suitable for use by everyone and for implementation in every new terminal is proposed. One of the only books which covers the complete SMS genesis from concept ideas to standardization of a first technical solution and its evolution to the present day. Describes the service concept including the limitation of the message length to 160 characters and explains the rationale behind the concept. Based on existing and newly retrieved documentation. Concludes that SMS has a long future since most future GSM phones will support SMS as the only messaging service, and so an SMS evolution is put forward.",

    "description": "The technological progress in multi-carrier (MC) modulation led orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to become an important part of beyond 3G cellular mobile communication standards, including LTE and WiMAX. In addition, the flexibility offered by the spread spectrum (SS) and time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques motivated many researchers to investigate several MC combined multiple access schemes, such as MC-CDMA, OFDMA and MC-TDMA. These schemes benefit from the advantages of each sub-system and offer high flexibility, high spectral efficiency, simple detection strategies and narrow-band interference rejection capability. Multi-Carrier and Spread Spectrum Systems is one of the first books to describe and analyze the basic concepts of multi-carrier OFDM transmission and its combination with spread spectrum (MC-CDMA). The different architectures and detection strategies as well as baseband-related transceiver components are explained. This includes topics like FEC channel coding and decoding, modulation and demodulation (IFFT/FFT), digital I/Q-generation, time and frequency synchronisation, channel estimation, frequency domain equalization and RF aspects such as phase noise and non-linearity issues.\nConcrete examples of its applications for cellular mobile communication systems (B3G/4G) are given. Further derivatives of MC-SS (such as OFDMA, SS-MC-MA and DFT-spread OFDM) and their corresponding applications in the LTE, WiMAX, WLAN and DVB-RCT standards are detailed. Capacity and flexibility enhancements of multi-carrier OFDM systems by different MIMO diversity techniques such as space time/frequency coding (STC, SFC) and software defined radio concepts are also described. Written in a highly accessible manner this book provides a unique reference on the topics of multi-carrier and spread spectrum communications, assisting 4G engineers with their implementation.",

In addition to the well-known contributions of Maxwell, Hertz, and Marconi, it examines work done by Heaviside, Tesla, and passionate amateurs such as the Kentucky melon farmer Nathan Stubblefield and the unsung hero Antonio Meucci. Looking at the story from mathematical, physics, technical, and other perspectives, the clearly written text describes the development of wireless within a vivid scientific milieu.History of Wirelessalso goes into other key areas, including: The work of J. C. Bose and J. A. Fleming; German, Japanese, and Soviet contributions to physics and applications of electromagnetic oscillations and waves; Wireless telegraphic and telephonic development and attempts to achieve transatlantic wireless communications; Wireless telegraphy in South Africa in the early twentieth century; Antenna development in Japan: past and present; Soviet quasi-optics at near-mm and sub-mm wavelengths; The evolution of electromagnetic waveguides; and, The history of phased array antennas. Augmenting the typical, Marconi-centered approach,History of Wirelessfills in the conventionally accepted story with attention to more specific, less-known discoveries and individuals, and challenges traditional assumptions about the origins and growth of wireless. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how various components and systems evolved. Written in a clear tone with a broad scientific audience in mind, this exciting and thorough treatment is sure to become a classic in the field.",

    "description": "The key feature of future mobile communication systems is the ability to deliver wideband and high bit-rate multimedia services alongside the traditional radio services such as voice, messaging and slow rate data. The broad range of services expected to be supported can be divided into different Quality of Service (QoS) classes. However, the provision of such mobile multimedia services under QoS guarantees will not be possible without a utilization of the air interface resources by means of Radio Resource Management (RRM) strategies that ensure the target QoS, the planned coverage area and that offer a high system capacity. Under this framework, this book focuses on the RRM concepts, including the theoretical background that serves as a basis for the description of specific RRM algorithms.\nThe RRM problem for UMTS is presented, and more specifically, for the FDD mode, which is based on a WCDMA scheme. More specifically, the different aspects that are covered are: the mobile communications sector and UMTS, including the evolution towards 4G systems, with an overview of the QoS concept which is key for the definition of RRM strategies; a detailed description of the radio interface in UMTS, as the basis for the implementation of RRM strategies; the fundamental concepts related with the development of RRM strategies in WCDMA networks; particular RRM algorithms in a variety of scenarios, trying to identify the key parameters and factors that influence their performance; and, the evolution of UMTS towards Beyond 3G systems and the concept of Common RRM in heterogeneous networks with the aid of some algorithm examples. This comprehensive title is essential reading for engineers and managers in radio engineering departments of UMTS network operators and UMTS equipment manufacturers. It will also prove insightful to researchers in the field of 3G and Beyond 3G systems and academics in any of these areas.",

GPRS is based on GSM communications and complements existing services such as circuit switched cellular phone connections and the Short Message Service (SMS).\nGPRS represents the bridge between 2G and 3G mobile telecommunications and is commonly referred to as 2.5G.\nImplementation of GPRS requires modification of the existing GSM networks in that GSM is a circuit switched technology while GPRS is packet oriented. GPRS enables packet data (the same as is used by an Ethernet LAN, WAN or the Internet) to be sent to and from a mobile statione.g. mobile phone, PDA or Laptop.\nWAP and SMS can also be sent using GPRS and individuals working with GPRS need to learn and understand how the mobile stations, the air interface, network architecture, protocol structures and signalling procedures must be modified.\nGPRS offers much higher data rates than GSM and can be combined with 3G technologies such as EDGE to give even higher bit-rates. It offers many benefits for customers and network operators: such as volume (rather then time) dependent billing and more efficient use of network resources.",

WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) is the radio interface for UMTS. WCDMA is characterised by use of a wider band than CDMA. It has additional advantages of high transfer rate, and increased system capacity and communication quality by statistical multiplexing, etc. WCDMA efficiently utilises the radio spectrum to provide a maximum data rate of 2 Mbit/s. UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) will offer a consistent set of services to mobile computer and phone users no matter where they are located in the world. Based on the GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) communication standard, UMTS, endorsed by major standards bodies and manufacturers, is the planned standard for mobile users around the world by 2002. Todaya s cellular telephone systems are mainly circuit switched, with connections always dependent on circuit availability. Packet switched connection, using the Internet Protocol (IP), means that a virtual connection is always available to any other end point in the network. It will also make it possible to provide new services, such as alternative billing methods (pay per bit, pay per session, flat rate, asymmetric bandwidth, and others).\nThe higher bandwidth of UMTS also promises new services, such as video conferencing and promises to realise the Virtual Home Environment (VHE) in which a roaming user can have the same services to which the user is accustomed when at home or in the office, through a combination of transparent terrestrial and satellite connections. aeo Provides an introduction to cellular networks and digital communications aeo Covers the air interface, radio access network and core network aeo Explains the Release a 99 specifications clearly and effectively aeo Discusses UMTS services and future services beyond 3G aeo Features numerous problems and solutions in order to aid understanding Ideal for Academics and students on telecommunications, electronics and computer science courses, research and development engineers working in mobile/wireless communications and Cellular operators and technical consultants.",

    "description": "Load balancing improves network performance by distributing traffic efficiently so that individual servers are not overwhelmed by sudden fluctuations in activity. Server Load Balancing is a guide to this critical component of high availability, clustering, and fault tolerance, all of which provide the infrastructure for reliable Internet sites and large corporate networks.Much of the information on load balancing comes from vendor-specific manuals that use inconsistent terminology and are often biased toward the products they cover. Server Load Balancing explains to engineers and technicians the concepts and terminology of load balancing and offers practical guidance for planning and implementing it in almost any environment. It includes a configuration guide with diagrams and sample configurations for installing, configuring, and maintaining products from the four major vendors:\n* Alteon WebSystems<br />\n* Cisco s CSS Series (formerly ArrowPoint)<br />\n* F5 s BIG-IP<br />\n* the Foundry ServerIron series\nBy comparing several load balancing products, you ll gain a deeper understanding of the technology and how best to use it to improve your network performance. No system administrator responsible for traffic management should be without this practical guide.",
