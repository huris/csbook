Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms. An in-depth analysis of the data center technology with real-life scenarios make\u00a0Data Center Fundamentals\u00a0an ideal reference for understanding, planning, and designing Web hosting and e-commerce environments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.

Underestimated hit ratios, compromised credit card records, perceived slow Web site access, or the infamous  Object Not Found  alerts make the difference between a successful online presence and one that is bound to fail.\nThese challenges can be solved in part with the use of data center technology. Data centers switch traffic based on information at the Network, Transport, or Application layers. Content switches perform the  best server  selection process to direct users  requests for a specific service to a server in a server farm. The best server selection process takes into account both server load and availability, and the existence and consistency of the requested content.\nData Center Fundamentals\u00a0helps you understand the basic concepts behind the design and scaling of server farms using data center and content switching technologies. It addresses the principles and concepts needed to take on the most common challenges encountered during planning, implementing, and managing Internet and intranet IP-based server farms.
